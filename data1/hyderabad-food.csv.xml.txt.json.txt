Pickles are one of the most revered condiments. Loved by people for its flavourful melange of spices, this condiment goes perfectly with a variety of dishes. From sandwiches to parathas, pickles are known for livening up any dish.

It’s worth mentioning that the semi-prepared pickles were stored inside plastic barrels that did not have any expiry date labels. Not to mention the passage that led to the garlic peeling area had damaged floors and holes. This means that there could be a possibility of infestation at the premises!Also Read: South African Man Shares Bhutta With Underprivileged; Netizens Say, “Dill Jeet Liya”Several Units Operating Under Unhygienic Conditions[caption id="attachment_639710" align="alignnone" width="770"] Pic credits: Canva[/caption]At another manufacturing company, the task force has seized tamarind and cumin seeds.

In fact, going by the records available, pest control for the premises had not been done for every 15 days. At another pickle-making unit, the team found that a water analysis report for the RO water used in cooking had not been available. Not to mention, part of the packing machinery was rusted and insect protective screens could not be found. Moreover, there were houseflies inside the manufacturing premises.It’s worth mentioning that some of the food handlers were wearing aprons and hair caps. Additionally, a true copy of the FSSAI license had been displayed.So, make sure to buy your pickles from only FSSAI-recognised brands and ensure all the licensing and certificates are correct.

Recent inspections by the food safety commissioner's task force in Hyderabad's Lakdikapul area have unearthed disturbing hygiene lapses including rodents and rotten food at several food establishments. The inspections, aimed at ensuring public safety, revealed a worrying disregard for basic food safety protocols.Rodents And Rotten Food In Hyderabad[caption id="attachment_628686" align="alignnone" width="770"] Image Courtesy: Canva (Representative Image)[/caption]Hotel New Fishland emerged as a prime example. Inspectors encountered a scene straight out of a nightmare: rats scurried freely across the floor and even ventured into the exhaust vents. This blatant disregard for pest control extended to the lack of any documentation when requested by the task force.The situation worsened with uncovered dustbins overflowing with waste, and concerning practises like storing partially prepared food items in the refrigerator without proper covers or labels. Further investigation revealed the use of unauthorised synthetic food colours, which were promptly confiscated. To top it off, the establishment failed to produce the food handlers' medical fitness certificates and the original food licence for inspection.Also Read: Why Is Calcium Carbide, An Artificial Ripener, Prohibited By The FSSAI?Notices Issued By Authorities[caption id="attachment_628688" align="alignnone" width="770"] Image Courtesy: Canva (Representative Image)[/caption]Inspectors observed similar violations at ‘The Bar’. During the inspection, they found the bar lacked a crucial document – a water analysis report.  Discovery of a missing water analysis report at The Bar caused alarm about the safety of drink and ice preparation. Unearthing expired food items like chicken, mayonnaise, and pasta, inspectors discarded them immediately.Hotel Ashoka presented a slightly better picture. Inspectors found a valid FSSAI licence, pest control records, and staff medical certificates. However, the hotel wasn't entirely spotless. Inspectors discovered expired food items like chicken and liquid caramel colour. A closer look by inspectors revealed infestations of black beetles in the green gram dal and cockroaches near the red meat storage area.Following the inspections, notices were issued to all three establishments by authorities in accordance with the FSSAI Act. These incidents highlight the critical need for stricter enforcement of food safety regulations in Hyderabad. Consumers deserve the assurance that the food they consume is prepared hygienically and with ingredients that are safe for consumption.Also Read: FSSAI Directs FBOs To Remove 100% Fruit Juice Claim From Labels, Ads; Calls It MisleadingThe task force's efforts in identifying these violations serve as a wake-up call for the food industry.

The Telangana Food Safety Department started making headlines after raiding Rameshwaram Cafe and Baahubali Kitchen in Hyderabad. Authorities discovered expired ingredients, insect infestation, and more unpleasant things inside the kitchens. This time, the officials headed to a few oil-repacking units in the city to conduct inspections and they found these establishments violating a lot of norms.The Telangana Food Safety Department Went To 3 Packing UnitsTaking to the X platform, Commissioner of Food Safety, Telangana (@cfs_telangana) shared crucial information regarding the raids with the Netizens.Task force team has conducted inspections in Oil re-packing units in Katedhan area on 28.05.2024.𝟭.

The establishments are Ambica Oil Industries, Bhagyanagar Oil Refineries, and Kedia Agro. The department mentioned each issue they spotted at these places and every regulation the establishments breached while operating regularly.One of the first major issues is the state of the windows. The team found open windows and doors in improper condition. The doors were not sturdy enough. These were not fitted properly to stop pests and insects from entering inside. The windows were kept open without the protection of any good-quality insect-proof screen. During the inspection, the officials saw that vehicles used for transporting products did not have a "valid FSSAI licence".Maintaining hygiene in these packing units is extremely crucial. Even the smallest of negligence can lead to the transportation of poor-quality products. However, these oil re-packing units in Katedhan did not follow all the crucial guidelines. They did not keep track of cleaning schedule reports, medical fitness certificates, pest control records, and recall plan documents for the products.Also read: Telangana Govt Enforces Ban On Gutka, Pan Masala With Tobacco &#038; Nicotine For A Year; Here&#8217;s WhyThe Officials Found More Problems At These Places[caption id="attachment_626186" align="alignnone" width="770"] Picture credit- Commissioner of Food Safety, Telangana (@cfs_telangana)[/caption]The next concern that they noticed was people not following the process of testing food materials using the Internal Laboratory or other accredited laboratories. There were no updates or records on this step. Also, the FBO did not hire technically qualified workers for these units.Also, the organisation did not give the much-needed uniforms, gloves, and headgear to the staff. Neither Bhagyanagar Oil Refineries nor Kedia Agro could show the FSSAI licence true copy.

Finding a safe place to eat is increasingly becoming a challenge these days. More and more cases are coming to light where customers are served stale and often fungus-ridden food items. This has happened not just in relatively unknown places but also in popular eateries. This has sparked significant safety concerns as people are increasingly worried about their health. Recently, a woman from Hyderabad got a pastry from a popular bakery but it was covered with fungus.Hyderabad Woman Finds Fungus In Pastry Ordered From BakeryNo food joint in #Hyderabad can be trusted anymore 😔 This is a popular bakery (5th Avenue Bakers) in #Sainikpuri that has been serving consumers for 30+ years. When I opened the Eclair, I found fungus in it. @cfs_telangana Let me know where I can file complaint for this. pic.twitter.com/oL8Po5NcwT— Preeti Biswas (@Preeti_Biswas) May 25, 2024Recently, a user named Preeti Biswas took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to share the unfortunate incident that happened. She got an eclair from a popular bakery in Hyderabad, 5th Avenue Bakers. However, when she opened the eclair, she found it covered with fungus.She said that the bakery is quite renowned and has been serving in the area for more than thirty years. Hence, this incident hits harder because it is supposedly a trustworthy food joint. Such incidents can not only be dangerous for unassuming customers but can also break the trust between a seller and a consumer.In her caption, she wrote, “No food joint can be trusted in Hyderabad anymore.” signifying how she felt betrayed by the stale pastry. She also tagged the concerned authority to ask for guidance in filing a complaint against the eatery.Also Read: Hyderabad: Food Safety Dept Raids Rameshwaram Cafe, Baahubali Kitchen; Finds Expired Food Items, Cockroaches & MoreThis Is How The Netizens Reacted To This Posti just ate a sandwich from there... 👀👀— Bala (@Bala__G) May 25, 2024Many people took to the comment section and sympathised with Biswas.

Beer lovers in Hyderabad and Bengaluru are facing a parched summer, with a significant shortage of their favourite beverage. This perfect storm has been brewed by a combination of factors: scorching temperatures, a seasonal surge in demand, and production challenges that are leaving suppliers struggling to keep up.Soaring Demand Leaves Shelves Bare[caption id="attachment_614534" align="alignnone" width="770"] Image Credit: Canva (Representative Image)[/caption]In Hyderabad, the beer shortage situation is particularly dire. Businessmen and liquor store owners are pleading with the state government to intervene and ensure a steady supply. Although beer demand usually rises in the summer, not only in Hyderabad but throughout Telangana, it has almost doubled this year, stated D Venkateshwar, a local businessman while talking to The Tatva.Despite the high demand, shops are facing inadequate stock, leaving shelves looking barer than usual. The reasons behind the shortage are multifaceted. The election model code, which restricts certain activities during elections, has reportedly impacted production capabilities.Additionally, water availability issues are further hindering breweries' ability to meet the rising demand. These factors are compounded by the naturally increased beer consumption that accompanies soaring summer temperatures.Also Read: Bengaluru's Beer Consumption Hits New Highs As Residents Seek Relief From HeatwaveBengaluru Pubs Face Supply Squeeze[caption id="attachment_614535" align="alignnone" width="770"] Image Credit: Canva (Representative Image)[/caption]Across state lines in Bengaluru, pubs and breweries are facing a similar predicament. The city's vibrant pub scene is under threat as demand outstrips supply. The hot weather, coupled with a series of long weekends, has seen beer consumption skyrocket.A representative from a major brewery in Marathahalli highlighted the unexpected surge. Fruit-flavoured beers are typically introduced throughout the summer. But the poor mango crop this year meant fewer sales of them, which pushed consumers toward ordinary beers.The situation is further exacerbated by the ongoing IPL season and an influx of tourists during long weekends. The brewery representative points to a stark difference in sales compared to last year, with a staggering 30,000 litres sold this year compared to just 9,000 litres in the same period last year.Also Read: Zero-Alcohol Beer, Maximum Cheers! Corona Cero Brings A Refreshing Twist To The Olympics Experience In 2024Both Hyderabad and Bengaluru are now grappling with how to address this shortage. Local businesses and consumers are urging authorities to take action to stabilise beer supply and meet the ever-increasing demand. Whether the summer heat will simmer down before the beer does remains to be seen.Cover Image Courtesy: Canva (Representative Image)
