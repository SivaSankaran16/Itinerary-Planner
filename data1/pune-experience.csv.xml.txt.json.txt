There's a common misconception involving the idea of how the topics of science and scientists are deemed boring. But is it so? We don't think so! Well, with an idea to bring together scientists and the public in a casual environment, Pune Science On Tap is a unique initiative making all the difference.What Is It?¬†¬†A post shared by Pune Science on Tap (@punescienceontap)The brainchild of Anoop Mahajan, a scientist from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) and his friend Nakul Bhonsale of ‚ÄòGreat State Aleworks‚Äô, an Indian craft brewery, ‚ÄòScience on Tap‚Äô has roped in experts from different fields to unlock the mysteries around complex subjects during each interactive session.The first session was organised at the residence of Mahajan‚Äôs friend in Kothrud which got popular through word-of-mouth.¬†Sessions are held once every month mainly over weekends and the topics range from Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Anthropology, Climate change, the Universe and machines.One of the unique aspects of Pune Science On Tap is the format of the talks.
