A resident of Pune has sparked a social media stir after claiming to find chicken in a veg biryani he ordered through Zomato, the popular food delivery platform. The man identified as Pankaj Shukla, took to X (formerly Twitter) to express his disappointment.Alleged Chicken In Veg Biryaniordered paneer biryani from pk biryani house karve nagar pune maharashtra and I found a chicken piece in it(I am a vegetarian) I already got refund but this os still a sin since I am a religious person and it has hurt my religious sentiments.#pkbiryani #zomato pic.twitter.com/nr0IBZl5ah‚Äî Pankaj shukla (@Pankajshuklaji2) May 13, 2024In his post, Mr Shukla included a video and photo of the alleged veg biryani ordered from Zomato alongside a message stating he discovered a piece of chicken in the dish. He emphasised that he is a vegetarian and expressed that the incident offended his religious beliefs. While acknowledging he received a full refund, Mr Shukla highlighted the importance of respecting dietary restrictions.Zomato responded swiftly to Mr Shukla's complaint. Their official customer care account commented on his post, emphasising their commitment to ensuring customer satisfaction and respecting religious beliefs. They requested Mr Shukla to share his order details for further investigation.Also Read:¬†From Spoilt Cake On Swiggy To Wrong Orders On Zomato, X Users Complain About Poor ServicesAccuracy And Respecting PreferencesHi @zomato , ordered veg food and got all non veg food. 4/5 of us were vegetarians.

In March, another X user reported receiving chicken instead of a vegetarian dish. Zomato responded promptly in that instance as well, offering an apology and requesting further information to investigate the matter.Food delivery platforms like Zomato play a crucial role in today's fast-paced world, offering convenience and a wide variety of culinary options. However, ensuring accuracy and adherence to dietary preferences remains a top priority. Incidents like this raise concerns about potential shortcomings in quality control measures employed by restaurants and delivery services.Following Mr. Shukla's complaint, it will be interesting to see the outcome of Zomato's investigation. Whether it leads to action against the restaurant or highlights a need for stricter internal protocols, addressing the issue effectively will be key to maintaining customer trust. The incident also underscores the importance of clear communication between customers and restaurants regarding dietary restrictions. While online platforms offer convenience, users must double-check order details before finalising their purchases.Also Read:¬†Redditor Shares How Zomato Charges ‚Çπ213.90 For 1 Shawarma & ‚Çπ44 More For Both 2 & 3 ShawarmaThis situation has sparked conversations online about respecting religious beliefs and ensuring food safety.
