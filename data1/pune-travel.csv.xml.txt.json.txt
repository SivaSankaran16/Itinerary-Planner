The Pune district administration is scrambling to improve tourist safety measures following the monsoon season's devastating start. Powerful currents at a waterfall near Lonavala's Bhushi Dam swept away a woman and four children, resulting in their deaths. In response, Pune has issued stricter guidelines for tourist access to various hotspots.Pune Restricts Tourist Access After 6 PM[caption id="attachment_644391" align="alignnone" width="770"] Cover Image Courtesy: Canva (Representative Image)[/caption]District Collector Suhas Divase is spearheading the initiative. Authorities will conduct a comprehensive hazard assessment across popular tourist destinations nestled within the Western Ghats. He has prioritised areas like Maval, Mulshi, Khed, Junnar, Bhor, Velha, and Ambegaon to identify potential risks and ensure tourist safety.Officials must conduct physical visits to tourist hotspots, including rivers, lakes, dams, waterfalls, forts, and forested areas. After these assessments, they will clearly demarcate prohibited zones and prominently display warning signs to alert visitors. They will completely close off areas deemed too hazardous to implement proper safety measures.Also Read: Pune: Tamhini Sanctuary Closed Till September 30; Forest Dept Restricts Access After 2 Tourist DeathsSafety At The Tourist Hotspot[caption id="attachment_644392" align="alignnone" width="770"] Cover Image Courtesy: Canva (Representative Image)[/caption]The monsoon season transforms Pune into a tourist hotspot, with large crowds flocking to Bhushi Dam, Pavana Dam, Lonavala, the historic Sinhagad Fort, Malshej Ghat, and Tamhini Ghat. To bolster safety at these popular destinations, Collector Divase has called for the deployment of crucial resources. Divers, rescue boats, lifeguards, and a plentiful supply of life jackets will be readily available at these locations. This joint effort will see revenue departments, forest departments, railways, municipal corporations, and the Public Works Department (PWD) working together.Divase emphasised that they will collaborate with NGOs, rescue foundations, experienced trekking groups, and local communities. They will utilise their expertise to create a safer environment for tourists.Also Read: 6 Zika Virus Cases Detected In Pune; 2 Pregnant Women Tested PositiveTo minimize risks after dark, officials will restrict tourist access to specific forest areas after 6 pm.

In a move prioritising visitor safety, the Pune forest department has enacted a temporary ban on tourist entry into the Tamhini sanctuary area. This closure, effective until September 30, follows two tragic tourist deaths at the Milky Bar waterfall in June, both caused by misjudging water depth during the monsoon season.Tamhini Sanctuary In Pune Closed Till September 30[caption id="attachment_643296" align="alignnone" width="770"] Image Courtesy: Canva (Representative Image)[/caption]The monsoon's impact on the sanctuary's landscape heightened risks, restricting access. According to a report by Hindustan Times, Tushar Chavan, Deputy Conservator of Forest (Wildlife) for the Pune department, explained that the monsoon transforms Plus Valley and the Tamhini forest.Heavy rains make roads slick and treacherous, yet tourists are understandably drawn to the area's allure during this time – pleasant weather, breathtaking scenery, and cascading waterfalls. Unfortunately, some visitors venture into the natural pools at the base of the falls. Here, the monsoon dramatically increases water depth and flow, creating a dangerous situation that can lead to fatal accidents.Two-Fold Purpose For The Ban[caption id="attachment_643297" align="alignnone" width="770"] Image Courtesy: Canva (Representative Image)[/caption]While Tamhini Sanctuary boasts unparalleled natural beauty, these features can become a source of danger during the monsoon. The forest department emphasises the importance of respecting the ban and prioritising personal safety. Visitors who disregard the restrictions and attempt to enter the forest area through trails will face legal repercussions under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.This temporary closure serves a two-fold purpose. First and foremost, it safeguards visitors from the potential dangers posed by the monsoon-altered landscape. Secondly, it allows the sanctuary's environment to flourish during this crucial period. The monsoon rains are vital for the health of the ecosystem, replenishing water sources and promoting abundant plant growth.Also Read: Uttarakhand: Forest Fire Claims Lives Of 4 Forest Officials At Binsar Wildlife SanctuaryTourists who yearn to explore Tamhini's wonders can utilise this temporary closure as an opportunity to research alternative destinations suitable for the monsoon season. With a bit of planning, they can ensure a safe and enjoyable experience. Come October, the Tamhini sanctuary will once again welcome visitors, ready to unveil its rejuvenated beauty after the monsoon's embrace.Cover Image Courtesy: Canva (Representative Image)
There are multiple advantages of travelling on a flight. Though the journeys cost a bomb and often burn a hole in our pockets, most passengers get to enjoy the best travel experiences. However, flyers sometimes face inconveniences for airlines' poor services. From flight cancellations to bad-quality food to stained seats, these are just a few of the troubles many come across at times. Recently, an Air India passenger ranted how a flight from Bengaluru to Pune was delayed and he had to sit on dirty seats.Man Slammed Air India For A Late Pune-Bound Flight From BengaluruAditya Kondawar took to the X platform to share about problems that he faced on this journey to Pune.Dear @AirIndiaX , Thank you for teaching me a very valuable lesson last nightNever and I mean it with all seriousness - I am never flying Air India Express or Air India in my life again - I will pay 100% extra cost if needed but will take other airlines that are on time (only…— Aditya Kondawar (@aditya_kondawar) June 25, 2024The passenger started ranting about his experiences mentioning how he would never travel with Air India Express or Air India again. "Never and I mean it with seriousness", he added. He is willing to pay 100 per cent additional cost, fly with other punctual airlines, or even take a bullock cart, but not travel with the Tata group-owned airlines.Aditya Kondawar was flying to Pune from Bengaluru. Flight IX 974 was scheduled to depart from the Bengaluru airport at 9:50 PM. However, a major delay caused the plane to take off around 12:15 to 12:20 AM. Unfortunately, this was not the end of his and other onboard passengers' miseries. The aircraft was stinking. Its seats were stained and dirty.Calling the flying experience a 'disaster', he shared that he has immense respect for the Tata Group and their leaders and also expects perfection from them.Also read: Passenger Finds Metal Blade In Air India Meal; Netizens Shocked, Call It A &#8216;Cutting-Edge Dining Experience&#8217;Airline Replied To The Passenger's ComplaintHi Aditya!

When you decide to take a flight to travel to a new destination or visit a long-adored city, chances are you don’t think about your flight getting delayed, by minutes or even hours! However, sometimes due to a variety of reasons, flights do get delayed, leaving passengers travelling in the same frazzled. And something similar happened to passengers of a SpiceJet flight to Dubai, who were stranded at the Pune Airport. Due to a massive delay, they ended up getting hungry and had to order food via delivery apps!SpiceJet Dubai Flight Delayed For 4 Hours In Pune[caption id="attachment_622518" align="alignnone" width="770"] Picture credits: Canva[/caption]A SpiceJet flight, SG-51 was supposed to take off for Dubai at 8:50 PM on Wednesday. However, due to some issues, the flight ended up being four hours late. As a result, it was only able to take off at 1:15 AM on Thursday. And, due to this four-hour delay, passengers were left hungry while they waited for the flight to take off. In fact, some passengers ended up ordering food via delivery apps after the airline just offered them a cup of tea. As revealed in a report in the Times of India, it was mentioned that a section of flyers had asked ground staffers, if they would get their ordered food. One of the passengers mentioned that a few employees did agree to fetch them food from the departure area. However, the airline did not provide any refreshments.Also Read: Riyadh’s King Khalid Airport Welcomes A 4-Venue Food Court; From Crêpe Affaire To Burger King, All That’s New Here!Passengers Resort To Order Online[caption id="attachment_494211" align="alignnone" width="770"] Picture credits: Canva[/caption]At this point, it’s worth mentioning that the guidelines of the Director General of Civil Aviation mention that the airline is supposed to serve refreshments to flyers if the flight is delayed over two hours. Since there is only a stall of snacks and beverages at the international lounge of Pune Airport, many people resorted to ordering from outside.It should be noted that a master concessionaire has been finalised for the new terminal building. For this, the contract has also been awarded and there will be a total of 20 food and beverage outlets in both domestic and international security hold areas. Not to mention, two of the five lounges will be in the international area as well. This was revealed in the same report by the Pune Airport Director, Santosh Dhoke.Have you also travelled by Pune Airport?

Whenever you visit an airport, you will always notice that the air-conditioners are functioning all the time. With enclosed surroundings and thousands of travellers waiting to board the flight, it will be extremely hot and humid without functioning ACs installed inside. Sadly, there has been a major breakdown in ACs reported at the terminal building of the Pune airport. The experiences of passengers are terrible.Passengers Are Complaining About AC Not Working At Pune Airport's Old Terminal Building[caption id="attachment_622518" align="alignnone" width="770"] Picture credit- CanvaImage for representation[/caption]At a time when staying indoors without air-conditioners seems to make us all sweaty and hot, flyers are facing the worst experiences inside the packed old terminal building of the airport. It has been a few days since a snag in the air-conditioning system has been identified. The weather is extremely hot in Pune with heatwaves affecting residents. During such times, defective ACs are the last thing one can even imagine.Passengers are taking to social media platforms to share their experiences and slamming the airport authorities for not taking any quick action to resolve the much-needed issue. Currently, the traffic at the airport is on the rise due to the ongoing summer vacations as residents are flying to different destinations. The rush, scorching heat, and malfunctioning air-conditioning system are creating chaos.In a conversation with Hindustan Times, the director of the Pune Airport stated the reason behind the major disturbance. The chiller plant of the terminal building is unable to operate at the moment as the 11 KV electricity supply faced some problems. The much-talked-about issue is likely to be solved by today evening as a team will be repairing it soon.Also read: Remember The Entry Fee Bangalore Airport Implemented?

Scheduled to commence in June, this ambitious project comes with a substantial budget of ₹25 crore. It signals a commitment from senior airport officials to enhance the travel experience for all passengers. As plans unfold, a seamless integration of the existing structure with the new terminal sets the stage for a revamped and upgraded airport facility. Pune Airport's Old Terminal Building Renovation[caption id="attachment_617087" align="alignnone" width="770"] Photo Credits: Pune Airport/X[/caption]Already, efforts to integrate the existing building with the new terminal have been completed.

Airport taxi rides – often a necessary evil for travellers. But what if you could slash those costs while making a new travel buddy? Enter GoPool, the innovative Indian startup that's transforming airport commutes by turning them into budget-friendly carpool experiences.The Spark Of An Idea  A post shared by Decoding Businesses (@decodingbusinesses)GoPool's app acts as a matchmaker for travellers. By entering their airport and destination details, users can connect with others headed in the same direction. This allows them to share a regular cab or ride-hailing service like Ola or Uber, splitting the fare amongst themselves. It's a win-win – travellers save money, and the environment benefits from fewer single-occupancy vehicles on the road.The brainchild of Akash Jadhav, a tech-savvy traveller, GoPool stemmed from a chance encounter. On a flight to Bengaluru last year, Jadhav overheard a fellow passenger headed to Electronics City, a destination over 50 kilometres away from the airport, which also happened to be in his direction. This sparked an idea – could he create a service that facilitated carpooling specifically for airport journeys?Research confirmed his hunch – many airports are far from city centres, leading to hefty cab charges for solo travellers.Also Read: Sharjah Residents Opt For Carpooling To Reach Workplace Amid Heavy Rains In UAE: Watch!Sharing The Ride, Sharing The Cost  A post shared by Bengaluru Trends (@bangalore_trends)GoPool caters primarily to light travellers. Since riders share the journey, luggage space is naturally limited. However, for those who pack efficiently, GoPool offers a significantly cheaper alternative to traditional taxis. The app also prioritises safety and security.Users can view potential co-travellers' profiles, including photos and ratings from previous journeys. Additionally, GoPool plans to integrate with existing ride-hailing platforms in the future to provide better access to a wider public.While carpooling isn't a new concept, GoPool's focus on airport trips fills a specific niche.  For budget-conscious travellers or those on short business trips, GoPool offers a practical and cost-effective solution. The environmental benefits are another positive – carpooling reduces carbon emissions and traffic congestion, especially around busy airports.Also Read: Did You Know Carpooling Is Ilegal In UAE?

Nestled within the majestic Western Ghats of Maharashtra lies the Bhimashankar Wildlife Reserve, a haven for biodiversity and home to an otherworldly phenomenon – a forest that glows! This captivating spectacle transforms the Bhimashankar landscape during the monsoon season, turning it into a bioluminescent wonderland.A Forest Bathed In Ethereal Light  A post shared by TheBohoSapiens (@thebohosapiens)As dusk descends and the first heavy rains lash the forest floor, a magical transformation unfolds. The decaying wood, roots, and branches become imbued with an ethereal light. This isn't the work of fairies or folklore; it's a captivating display of bioluminescence, a natural process where living organisms emit light.The secret behind the Bhimashankar's glow lies in a fascinating organism – the Mycena fungus.  These microscopic mushrooms, often mistaken for moss, play a starring role in the forest's nightly light show.  Mycena produces a special enzyme called luciferase, which interacts with luciferin, a light-emitting compound present in decaying wood. This interaction triggers a chemical reaction, resulting in a mesmerising bioluminescent glow.Also Read: In Singapore & Melbourne, Wander Through The Illuminated Forbidden Forest & Relive Your Favourite Harry Potter MomentsA Glowing Spectacle Unlike Any Other[caption id="attachment_615364" align="alignnone" width="770"] Image Courtesy: Canva (Representative Image)[/caption]The bioluminescence in Bhimashankar is particularly remarkable due to its intensity and scale. While bioluminescence is found in various ecosystems worldwide, the sheer abundance of Mycena in the Bhimashankar forest creates a truly breathtaking display.However, witnessing this natural marvel requires a touch of luck and perfect timing. The bioluminescence is most prominent after heavy monsoon rains, typically between July and September.  If you're fortunate enough to be there on the right night, the forest floor will appear to be carpeted with an otherworldly green glow, while fallen branches and tree trunks seem to radiate an ethereal light.The Bhimashankar forest reserve offers more than just a luminous spectacle.  This biodiverse sanctuary is home to a rich tapestry of flora and fauna, including endangered species like the Indian giant squirrel and a variety of reptiles.  Nine tribal villages also lie within the reserve, adding to the cultural richness of the region.Also Read: Uttarakhand: Incidents Of 24 Forest Fires Reported In Past 24 Hours; Blaze Claims 5 LivesSo, if you're seeking an adventure beyond the ordinary, consider a trip to the Bhimashankar Wildlife Reserve during the monsoon season.
