A few days ago, a doctor in Mumbai’s Malad found a human finger in an ice cream cone ordered online. The disturbing incident led to many questioning the food safety standards, especially in factories. Now, in a new development in this case, the Mumbai Police suspect that more than 100 Yummo ice cream cones could have been contaminated. This believed that the blood from the severed finger of the feeder machine operator could be the reason. The police have taken his blood samples to match DNA and check if he has any serious illness.Police Suspects Severed Finger Contaminated 100+ Yummo Ice Cream Cones[caption id="attachment_638801" align="alignnone" width="770"] Image Courtesy: Canva (representative image)[/caption]A couple of days back, a Mumbai-based doctor found a severed human finger in the ice cream. He had ordered the ice cream online. This led to public outrage as people questioned the brand’s integrity and the standards of food safety in India. Now, as per a new development reported by Mid-Day, the Mumbai Police suspect that more than 100 Yummo ice cream cones could have been contaminated. This is mainly because of the blood from the severed finger of the feeder machine operator.According to the report, the ice cream machine at the factory packs 100 ice creams per batch. This means that at least 100 ice cream cones are at risk of contamination from the blood from the severed finger. For now, the police have blood samples of the feeder machine operator and sent them for medical examination to match DNA and to check if he has any serious illness. They believe if the blood report detects any major diseases, the matter will become very serious, and the investigation will get prolonged.Also Read: After Centipede & Finger, Woman Finds Dead Rat In Hershey’s Chocolate Syrup; Netizens Say, “New Fear Unlocked”The Incident & FSSAI’s SuspensionLike most of us, Malad-based Dr. Orlem Brendan Serrao ordered Yummo ice cream cones online.

They filed a complaint and the police immediately launched an investigation. Walko Food Co Ltd and Fortune Dairy, the company and the factory where the ice cream was made, are not ready to accept responsibility for the incident.This case raises concerns about food adulteration and endangering human life. Seeing this severity, the Food Safety Standards of India (FSSAI) has taken some steps. They have decided to suspend the licence of the manufacturer that supplies ice cream to the Yummo brand in Western India.Cover Image Courtesy: X/@SachinGuptaUP & Canva (representative image)
