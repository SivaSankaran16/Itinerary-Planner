The ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 has captivated cricket fans around the world, with an unexpected surge of interest from India. Notably, major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore have seen a significant increase in flight bookings to New York, according to travel data from Skyscanner. Surge In Flight Bookings, Hotels & More For World Cup Credits: Canva Skyscanner, a leading travel search engine, reported a remarkable uptick in flight bookings from India to New York during the World Cup period. Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore have been the top three cities showing this trend. The United States is a popular travel destination for Indians, offering a plethora of attractions and experiences. The World Cup provides an additional incentive for fans to visit. This is what the flight booking trend looked like:

From Delhi to New York, the week of June 3rd saw the greatest booking volume of the month, with a 265% increase over the same week last year. Bookings from Mumbai to New York increased thrice during the week of June 17th compared to the same period last year. This shows an increase in booking volume ahead of the India vs Afghanistan match on June 20th and India vs Bangladesh on June 22nd. Bookings from Bangalore to New York increased by 1.2 times compared to last year during the week of June 17th. Bookings increased threefold for the week of June 3rd, compared to the same week last year.

Direct flights and improved air travel connectivity between India and the US have made it easier for fans to make the trip. The surge in flight bookings has been mirrored by a notable increase in hotel reservations. According to Skyscanner data, there is a significant demand for accommodation from tourists visiting St. Julian’s to watch the T20 event, with only 7% of rooms remaining available.

Why Are Electricity Bills Soaring In Mumbai?

With ongoing heatwaves, Mumbai residents face a tough choice

Mumbai residents are facing a double whammy this summer – scorching temperatures and skyrocketing electricity bills. The brutal Mumbai heatwave has forced residents to crank up their air conditioners, leading to a surge in power consumption which has resulted in electricity bills doubling for some Mumbaikars, with most experiencing increases between 50% and 80% compared to the previous month. Mumbai Heatwaves Lead To Increased Electricity Bill Amounts Image Credits: Canva (Representative Image) The city’s four main electricity distribution companies – Tata Power, BEST, Adani Electricity Mumbai Ltd., and Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. (MSEDCL) – have all reported a significant rise in power consumption. According to officials, the primary culprit is the increased use of air conditioners, with many residents running them for extended periods throughout the day and night to escape the scorching heat. Adding to the woes, many consumers were unaware of the tiered structure of Mumbai’s electricity tariffs. These slabs, with increasing rates for higher consumption, meant that with their upped AC usage, many residents crossed into higher tariff brackets, further inflating their bills.

They’ve launched awareness campaigns across the city, educating residents about their consumption patterns and offering tips on how to manage their electricity use. Additionally, for high-consumption customers, some companies, like Adani Electricity, employed predictive analytics to identify potential slab changes and proactively reached out with targeted messages and emails. This proactive approach reportedly helped reduce complaints regarding bill hikes by 15-20%. While the recent tariff revision for the financial year 2025 and fuel adjustment charges also contributed marginally to the overall increase, power companies maintain that the biggest factor is the surge in consumption pushing users into higher slabs. They acknowledge a 10-11% rise in overall tariffs but emphasise that this alone wouldn’t significantly impact bills.

Mumbai’s Iconic Haji Ali Dargah To Get Major Facelift; Here’s All You Need To Know

The pathway leading to the religious site will be widened.

by Shreya Ghosh Updated: June 27, 2024

Share

Haji Ali Dargah is one of Mumbai’s iconic revered sites. The religious place welcomes thousands of visitors from different faiths every day. For many tourists travelling to the City of Dreams, this famous site often gets included in their travel itineraries. The time has come to upgrade a part of this sacred mosque in Mumbai by broadening the pathway leading to Haji Ali Dargah. Read on to know the upcoming construction to be conducted here. Pathway Of Haji Ali Dargah Will Get A Significant Transformation

Picture credit- Wikimedia Commons As we all know this religious site often gets overcrowded by visitors. A major decision has been taken to prioritise everyone’s safety and manage the footfall. Mumbai’s Haji Ali Dargah will soon go under a significant transformation as the Mumbai District Collectorate stated about broadening the pathway heading to the site. According to a report by Mumbai Live, this road will be upgraded to 10 metres from the present 5 metres. Not only expanding the road in width, there are plans to increase its height as well. The management of Haji Ali Dargah has asked for a height upgrade. Responding to the request, the concerned authorities will also work on the pathway’s height and raise it to 7 metres. Another key part of the facelift is developing 2 parapet walls along either side of the pathway leading to the dargah. These walls will be constructed to secure visitors’ safety, especially from high tides. The Central Water & Power Research Centre has approved the project idea, according to a report by Oneindia. The Maharashtra Coastal Zone Authority also nodded yes to it. The estimated budget for the construction is ₹19 crores. PWD’s harbour engineering department will have the primary responsibility of the Haji Ali Dargah’s pathway broadening project.

The expected duration required to complete the planned development is about 18 months. The money needed for the transformation will be taken from the District Planning Development Committee. Each parapet wall to be built on both sides of the pathway will be 264 metres.

JioMart Rolls Out Pilot Grocery Delivery Services In Mumbai & Navi Mumbai; Will Deliver Items Within An Hour

JioMart began piloting quick commerce service in select areas of Mumbai and Navi Mumbai and aims to expand to over 1,000 cities.

Reliance Retail’s JioMart has started a pilot project of instant delivery services in certain areas of Navi Mumbai and Mumbai. They have begun this delivery under the ‘hyperlocal delivery’ section of the JioMart app. In this pilot project, they aim to deliver groceries and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) within an hour. Read on to know more about this. JioMart Enters Quick Commerce Race

Image Courtesy: Canva (representative image) JioMart has entered a sector that is currently ruled by the likes of Blinkit and Zepto. As per a report in The Economic Times, JioMart has started the pilot of quick commerce delivery for groceries and FMCG products in select areas of Mumbai and Navi Mumbai areas. They are currently aiming to fulfil delivery orders within an hour and strive to bring this delivery time to 30 minutes in the future. As per reports, this instant delivery service has been integrated into the JioMart app itself. One can find it under the ‘hyperlocal delivery’ option. As of now, the shortest delivery time can go up to 12 hours, and some even to 3 days in some cases. Under this pilot, JioMart will rely on Reliance Retail’s warehouses and store networks for delivery. Furthermore, in areas where their store network isn’t easily accessible, they will make use of local Kirana stores that will become a part of the JioMart Partner Initiative.

Image Courtesy: Canva (representative image) As per an Economic Times report, this isn’t the first time JioMart has entered the quick commerce race. They had launched a JioMart Express service a while back that delivered groceries within 90 minutes. However, it was shut down last year. This time around, they have started small and will eventually increase their delivery range. For now, they aim to scale up the service to cover over 1,000 cities across India if this pilot project is successful. What will set JioMart’s service apart from apps like Blinkit and Zepto is that they do not wish to enter the 10-15-20 minute delivery model. Instead, they will make use of Reliance Retail’s 3,500 stores and warehouses. This way, they will avoid hiring a large fleet of delivery personnel and dark stores as well. In a world where we have become so used to 10-15 minutes delivery, do you think JioMart’s 30-60 minutes delivery option will make the cut? Let us know your thoughts on this in the comments section.

Mumbaikars, we have amazing news for you. The ongoing construction of the much-awaited Mumbai Metro 3 is all set to be completed this year. The first cabinet meeting was conducted on Wednesday. Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde chaired the significant meeting. The key project of Mumbai Metro 3 and its completion were discussed on Wednesday. Mumbai Metro 3 Project Will Be Completed By The End Of This Year Taking to the X platform, 🇮🇳 Amαr (@Amarrrrz) shared pictures and videos of this important project being developed in the City of Dreams.

The Maharashtra Cabinet, led by CM @mieknathshinde, approved a direct payment of 1163 crores to the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation for the Metro-3 project. The project, costing 37,275.50 crores, is 98.1% complete, with the first phase from Sipz to BKC set to start by September… pic.twitter.com/fU1SwFiDhF — 🇮🇳 Amαr (@Amarrrrz) June 27, 2024

The Maharashtra Government stated about the completion of the Colaba-SEEPZ Mumbai Metro 3 project by the end of this year, by December-end. This crucial project’s first phase is between SEEPZ (Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone) and Bandra Kurla Complex. According to a report by Sarkaritel, this phase will be commissioned by September, followed by completing the overall work by the end of this year. This is not the first time that the concerned authorities and departments shared a specified timeline for completing the entire Colaba-SEEPZ Mumbai Metro 3 project. Previously, this construction was scheduled to be finished by September 2024, according to a report by Moneycontrol. However, the plans changed later. And now, the Maharashtra Government shared its decision to complete it by the end of December 2024. An important decision of the cabinet meeting was the approval to provide ₹1,163 crore from the Maharashtra government’s share to the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation rather than the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. The state Cabinet discussed a ₹22,250 crore loan to be taken from HUDCO. This hefty loan’s purpose is to acquire land for the key Virar-Alibaug Multimodal Corridor in Mumbai.

According to the information provided by the Chief Minister’s Office, 98 per cent of the development is already completed. This is indeed great news. It looks like the construction is close to coming to an end. Also, another significant fact to note here is that the budget of the project now changed to ₹37,275.50 crore.
