On a cloudy July 1, 1856, history unfolded at the Royapuram station in Madras (now Chennai). A brand new train, carrying over 300 passengers, embarked on a journey to Wallajah Road, marking the momentous occasion of South India's first passenger train service.South India's First Passenger TrainIt was on this day that the first train service from Royapuram started its journey to Walajah Road in 1856 - truly a landmark day! Royapuram is the oldest standing station building in the Indian subcontinent and the train service started after the building was built. #landmark pic.twitter.com/phWXraWtnA— Ananth Rupanagudi (@Ananth_IRAS) July 1, 2024Few are aware that Royapuram holds the distinction of being the oldest standing railway station building in all of India. Just three days prior to the inaugural train service, Lord Harris, the Governor of Madras at the time, officially opened the newly constructed station on June 28, 1856.However, the building fell into disrepair over the years, becoming a dilapidated structure with overgrown vegetation. Thankfully, the Southern Railway recognised its historical significance and undertook renovations, reopening it to the public in 2005.Also Read: Chennai-Kerala Special Trains Get 6 Additional Trips; From Dates To Stations, Details Inside168 Years Of History#Royapuram: Showcasing the rich legacy of Railways in #India 🚂✨Explore the history and heritage of one of India's oldest #RailwayStations, where tradition meets innovation. #IndianRailways #RailwayHeritage #TravelIndia #SouthernRailway #IncredibleIndia pic.twitter.com/9R29ROc6YD— Southern Railway (@GMSRailway) July 1, 2024Royapuram's unique status lies in being the first station building constructed in the subcontinent before any train services even commenced. While Bombay witnessed the first train service in India back in April 1853, the iconic Victoria Terminus building wasn't inaugurated by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway until 1888. Similarly, Howrah on the eastern coast only received its present-day station building in 1905. When the first train journey from Howrah to Hughli took place in 1854, the station consisted merely of a temporary tin shed.The Carnatic region boasts a fascinating connection to the earliest days of Indian railways. Surprisingly, the first initiative to survey a potential rail line, stretching from Madras to Bangalore, dates back to 1828 – a mere three years after the Stockton-Darlington line became the world's first operational passenger railway. Unfortunately, this early attempt seems to have yielded no concrete results.Also Read: End Of An Era! Britannia Industries To Shut Down Its 77-YO Biscuit Unit In Kolkata; Here's WhyInterestingly, the pioneer of railway construction in India was a military engineer, Colonel Arthur Cotton, who ironically became a vocal opponent of extensive railway development, advocating instead for the promotion of inland water transportation. Around 1838, he laid a short stretch of track from Madras City towards the Red Hills, intended solely for transporting road materials. However, this endeavour cannot be considered the true beginning of Indian railways as it wasn't designed for passenger or goods traffic.Cover Image Courtesy: Wikimedia Commons

These routes connect major educational institutions such as Presidency and Nandanam colleges. As of now, a commendable 448 buses have already been equipped with automatic doors. The remaining installations are also set to be completed within the upcoming week.The decision to implement automatic doors comes after previous attempts to discourage students from travelling on footboards.

According to the Times of India, Alby John, the managing director of MTC, highlighted the practical difficulties faced by conductors in enforcing these rules consistently. He also pointed out the potential safety hazards that students faced.Upon the completion of this retrofitting initiative, nearly two-thirds of MTC's fleet will be equipped with automatic doors.

Airports in Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Mumbai have reported checked-in baggage delivery times getting better in the past few months.According to a report by The Financial Express, the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) started a practice back in January 2024 to focus on this issue. The primary goal was to make the services better at the above-mentioned airports. The departments decided to start this plan as there were several problems with passengers receiving their luggage after a long time.The plan has significantly impacted the entire process as more than 90 per cent of passengers are now getting their baggage within just half an hour of landing at the airport, the Civil Aviation Ministry stated. From January 2024, the duration has surged by 30 per cent. The Civil Aviation Ministry further added that it was only 62.2 per cent of flyers who received checked-in luggage on time in January.
