According to the press conference held by the duo on Saturday, it was revealed that India will now be providing medical e-visa facilities to Bangladeshis. This comes as a massive relief for those who are travelling to India for the purpose of their medical treatment. Here is all about it!India To Introduce Medical E-Visas For BangladeshisLaunched the Fast Track Immigration-Trusted Traveller Program today.

It’s worth mentioning that the Bangladeshi PM is on a two-day visit to India. As such, this is an important development as this initiative is certainly going to help several Bangladesh nationals receive important medical care in the country. In fact, it was also announced that India will be opening a new Assistant High Commission in Rangpur, which is bound to benefit the people in the northwest of Bangladesh.Also Read: Fast Track Immigration-Trusted Traveller Programme Introduced At Delhi’s IGI Airport; What is It, Process & MoreWhat Is A Medical Visa?[caption id="attachment_504972" align="alignnone" width="770"] Pic credits- Canva[/caption]But what is a medical visa is basically a visa that is given to foreigners who travel to the country for the purpose of medical treatment. It’s worth noting that if a foreign national wants to receive treatment under the Indian system of medicines, their case is also considered under the visa. For this purpose, hospital authorities must share documents that have been issued by them. This includes a medical invitation letter and appointment letter as per the format given in Appendix II on the official email ID of the Indian mission (concerned area). Additionally, hospitals must also share a letter to the foreign nationals for the extension of the visa and registration. This must be in the formats given in Appendix III and IV, respectively.It should be noted that the initial period of validity of a medical visa can be up to one year or the period of treatment, whichever is less. However, this visa can be extended for a further period of one year by the FRRO/FRO. This can be done if a medical certificate certificate is produced by the government or the ICMR or the NABH or the MCI or CGHS recognised hospitals.So, with this initiative, many Bangladesh were seeking important medical attention or going to find it easier to travel.Cover Image Courtesy: Canva & X/PMOIndia

Travelling on flights is a great experience. Not only is it a fast transportation mode but it also provides comfort and many other conveniences. Operations and services provided by airlines and airports are improving with time. All these are enhancing most passengers' travel experiences. Among so many advancements, some bustling airports in India have reported improvements in baggage delivery.Passengers Are Getting Bags Faster; Thanks To The Better Baggage Delivery Process[caption id="attachment_622122" align="alignnone" width="770"] Picture credit- Canva[/caption]Many of us have heard people complaining about waiting for a long time to get bags at different airports. Unfortunately, many of us have faced such issues in the past as well. The good news is that the time required for baggage delivery on the conveyor belts has improved to a huge extent in some of the busiest airports in India. Airports in Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Mumbai have reported checked-in baggage delivery times getting better in the past few months.According to a report by The Financial Express, the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) started a practice back in January 2024 to focus on this issue. The primary goal was to make the services better at the above-mentioned airports. The departments decided to start this plan as there were several problems with passengers receiving their luggage after a long time.The plan has significantly impacted the entire process as more than 90 per cent of passengers are now getting their baggage within just half an hour of landing at the airport, the Civil Aviation Ministry stated. From January 2024, the duration has surged by 30 per cent. The Civil Aviation Ministry further added that it was only 62.2 per cent of flyers who received checked-in luggage on time in January. From March, the numbers have jumped over 90 per cent.Also read: Remember The Entry Fee Bangalore Airport Implemented?

The initiative of the BCAS and proper advice by the Civil Aviation Ministry are continuing to show great results and the numbers are also improving with time. In May 2024, about 92.5 per cent of luggage was delivered in just 30 minutes. In fact, the International Air Transport Association's rules state that checked-in baggage needs to be delivered within 30 minutes of landing.Also read: Mumbai International Airport Reports Passenger Traffic Of 4.36 Million In April; Records 26,870 ATMs Have you ever waited too long to grab your luggage from the conveyor belt?Cover Image Courtesy: Canva
We have all, once in our life, come across people who are travelling without a ticket on trains or buses. And while there are some exceptional instances that make us feel okay about it, more often than not it is a nuisance for other travellers who pay the exuberant ticket prices for safety and comfort during their travels. And this Redditor’s recent post brings this behaviour of ticketless travellers into the spotlight again. Sharing her experience, the Redditor talked about how freeloaders made excuses to the officials to travel without proper tickets. In her post, she highlighted that this isn’t just about free travelling but about traveller’s safety in the trains.Redditor With 1AC Ticket Share How Ticketless Travellers Became A HassleEven 1st AC isn't free from freeloadersbyu/kriticalmission inindianrailwaysReddit user, @kriticalmission, recently shared her experience of travelling with ticketless passengers in 1AC coach in the ‘Indian Railways’ subreddit. In her post, she mentioned that while travelling from Hubli to Hyderabad, some people “hopped on to the 1st AC coach” and sat right outside their coupe. When they complained about this, the coach attendant responded but the freeloaders refused to leave!According to her post, they made excuses like “Baccha hai”, “next station mein utar jaayenge”, and “baahar hi baithenge” as they refused to move from their place outside her coupe. This frustrated the Redditor who mentioned how “despite raising the issue they got away with it.” This incident made her question why people like us even “bother paying extra for the sake of safety if this is what we have to deal with?”What’s worse is that some people called her “entitled.” To this, she responded that the issue isn’t about “segregation” but about following rules. And how some people are getting away with it while others have to pay and still suffer.Also Read: Sikkim Celebrates 49 Years Of Statehood Today & Here’s Why This State Should Be On Every Travel Lover’s Bucket List!Netizens React & Share Their Two Cents On This[caption id="attachment_618815" align="alignnone" width="770"] Image Courtesy: Wikipedia[/caption]Hundreds of comments flooded this post and people shared their own experiences and how this situation has got worse in recent times.

An Indigo flight scheduled for Cochin was delayed on May 14, 2024 after experiencing a technical glitch while taxiing for departure at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) in Hyderabad.

Indigo officials have not yet disclosed the exact nature of the glitch.

Airport taxi rides – often a necessary evil for travellers. But what if you could slash those costs while making a new travel buddy? Enter GoPool, the innovative Indian startup that's transforming airport commutes by turning them into budget-friendly carpool experiences.The Spark Of An Idea  A post shared by Decoding Businesses (@decodingbusinesses)GoPool's app acts as a matchmaker for travellers. By entering their airport and destination details, users can connect with others headed in the same direction. This allows them to share a regular cab or ride-hailing service like Ola or Uber, splitting the fare amongst themselves. It's a win-win – travellers save money, and the environment benefits from fewer single-occupancy vehicles on the road.The brainchild of Akash Jadhav, a tech-savvy traveller, GoPool stemmed from a chance encounter. On a flight to Bengaluru last year, Jadhav overheard a fellow passenger headed to Electronics City, a destination over 50 kilometres away from the airport, which also happened to be in his direction. This sparked an idea – could he create a service that facilitated carpooling specifically for airport journeys?Research confirmed his hunch – many airports are far from city centres, leading to hefty cab charges for solo travellers.Also Read: Sharjah Residents Opt For Carpooling To Reach Workplace Amid Heavy Rains In UAE: Watch!Sharing The Ride, Sharing The Cost  A post shared by Bengaluru Trends (@bangalore_trends)GoPool caters primarily to light travellers. Since riders share the journey, luggage space is naturally limited. However, for those who pack efficiently, GoPool offers a significantly cheaper alternative to traditional taxis. The app also prioritises safety and security.Users can view potential co-travellers' profiles, including photos and ratings from previous journeys. Additionally, GoPool plans to integrate with existing ride-hailing platforms in the future to provide better access to a wider public.While carpooling isn't a new concept, GoPool's focus on airport trips fills a specific niche.  For budget-conscious travellers or those on short business trips, GoPool offers a practical and cost-effective solution. The environmental benefits are another positive – carpooling reduces carbon emissions and traffic congestion, especially around busy airports.Also Read: Did You Know Carpooling Is Ilegal In UAE?

Hyderabad's transportation landscape is undergoing a seismic shift, with the advent of free bus rides significantly altering commuter behaviour. As women flock to buses, the once bustling metro trains are feeling the impact. Amidst this dynamic scene, L&T, the driving force behind Hyderabad's metro project, contemplates an exit strategy post-2026.L&T Contemplates Post-2026 Sale Amidst Shifting Transportation Trends[caption id="attachment_616479" align="alignnone" width="770"] Photo Credits: Wikimedia Commons[/caption]Director of L&T R. Shankar Raman clarified this, explaining how the Congress government's free bus ride promotion had impacted the metro system's appeal. The dynamics of public transport are under close scrutiny because L&T owns a sizable 90% of the metro project, with the Telangana government owning the remaining 10%. With its 65-year concession, Hyderabad's commuters first viewed the metro project as a shining example of efficiency and modernity.But the Mahalakshmi bus scheme, which provides free rides on government-run non-AC buses to women and transgender people, changed the face of transport. According to India Today, Raman emphasised how this programme resulted in a notable distribution of travel preferences by gender. Attracted by the promise of free transport, women flocked to buses, and men found themselves drawn to the metro, even though tickets cost an average of ₹35.Also Read: Kerala’s Wellness Tourism Industry Prepares for Weather Challenges Amidst Delayed Promotional EffortsFree Bus Rides Vs. Paid Metro[caption id="attachment_616478" align="alignnone" width="770"] Photo Credits: Wikimedia Commons[/caption]There were noticeable effects of this change. Raman observed a drop in metro usage, which he attributed to the attraction of free bus rides. In light of declining ridership, he underlined the necessity of easing the financial burden on the Hyderabad metro project. According to India Today, L&T negotiated strategically with the Telangana government and was able to obtain a sizable soft loan of ₹3,000 crore to lessen the burden.Although Raman acknowledged the efforts of the state government to increase public transport accessibility, he expressed concerns regarding an excessive dependence on vehicles that are prone to pollution. He emphasised that a city like Hyderabad needs a well-balanced transport ecosystem, and he argued that using populist measures alone is not a smart strategy.Raman's insights illuminated the complexities of Hyderabad's changing transportation landscape and the opportunities and challenges that accompany the metro project, even as L&T reported a notable increase in consolidated net profit.Cover Image Courtesy: Wikimedia Commons
