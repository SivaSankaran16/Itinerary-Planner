The rising cost of vegetables is pinching Bengaluru households, forcing many to make difficult choices about their dietary needs. A recent survey conducted by LocalCircles, a community social media platform, paints a concerning picture. With nearly 1,700 responses from Bengaluru residents, the survey reveals that over 16% of families have already begun cutting back on essential vegetables like potatoes, tomatoes, and onions. This trend is likely to continue, with many others expressing anxiety about further reducing their vegetable intake if prices exceed ₹60 per kg. Bengaluru Sees Rise In Cost Of Essential Vegetables[caption id="attachment_644597" align="alignnone" width="770"] Image Courtesy: Canva (Representative Image)[/caption]The past month has seen a dramatic surge in vegetable prices across Bengaluru. Some vegetables have skyrocketed to a shocking ₹ 200 per kg, leaving a significant dent in household budgets. While some families can resort to strategic planning and avoid purchasing the most expensive vegetables, essential items like onions and tomatoes present a unique challenge. These vegetables form the backbone of many Indian dishes, making it difficult to completely eliminate them from the grocery list.According to a report by Deccan Herald, Padma S., a homemaker from South Bengaluru stated that dishes requiring a lot of vegetables can definitely be adjusted by avoiding them. However, tomatoes and onions, which are practically essential ingredients in almost everything cooked, are still being used, albeit more cautiously. Beans, which have become incredibly expensive, are not being bought now.Also Read: Maharashtra FDA Cracks Down On McDonald's, Suspends Licence For Using Cheap Vegetable Oil Instead Of CheeseResidents Struggle With Rising Costs[caption id="attachment_644598" align="alignnone" width="770"] Image Courtesy: Canva (Representative Image)[/caption]Padma's experience reflects the sentiment of many Bengaluru residents struggling with the rising costs.  Some families can resort to substituting vegetables or finding creative ways to use less. The impact on dietary intake and overall health is undeniable. The survey by LocalCircles underscores the urgency for local authorities to take action.The current situation also raises questions about long-term solutions. Encouraging sustainable farming practices, improving storage facilities, and strengthening infrastructure to minimize spoilage can all play a vital role in ensuring year-round availability of vegetables at reasonable prices. Additionally, promoting awareness about seasonal vegetables and educating consumers on alternative recipes that utilize less expensive ingredients can empower families to make informed choices.Also Read: Picture Of Wide-Eyed Woman At Bengaluru Vegetable Shop Leaves Netizens In Splits; Say “Try Stealing Them Now”The rising cost of vegetables is not just an economic issue.

Get ready for a cleaner, safer street food experience in Karnataka! The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is bringing roadside eateries under its licencing regime, ensuring they meet mandatory food safety standards. This move addresses long-standing concerns about hygiene practices at these popular food stalls.FSSAI Licencing For Roadside Eateries[caption id="attachment_642487" align="alignnone" width="770"] Image Courtesy: Canva (Representative Image)[/caption]For years, roadside vendors have operated outside formal regulations. This lack of oversight has raised questions about the cleanliness of food preparation, storage, and handling. According to a report by Deccan Herald, The new licencing system aims to fix this by ensuring vendors adhere to legally mandated hygiene standards, promoting safer and healthier street food for everyone.Previously, only established restaurants required FSSAI licences. Roadside stalls, however, fell under the "street vendor" category and weren't subject to the same rules. This distinction is disappearing. The FSSAI is actively integrating these vendors into the system, bringing them under the umbrella of food safety regulations.The transition won't be immediate. Recognising the challenges, officials are proactively running awareness campaigns to educate roadside stall owners. These campaigns, which include Information Education Communication (IEC) activities, aim to make the licencing process clear and explain the benefits of following food safety protocols.Also Read: 22% Of Pani Puri In Karnataka Fails To Meet FSSAI Quality Standards; Cancer-Causing Substances FoundKnowledge And Resources Provided To Vendors[caption id="attachment_642490" align="alignnone" width="770"] Image Courtesy: Canva (Representative Image)[/caption]The focus isn't on shutting down vendors, but on improving their operations. By providing them with the necessary knowledge and resources, the FSSAI hopes to empower them to comply with the regulations. This collaborative approach will not only elevate food safety standards but also build trust and legitimacy for these vendors.The new licensing system holds immense potential for both consumers and vendors. Customers can enjoy their favourite street food with greater peace of mind, knowing it has been prepared under hygienic conditions. Vendors, on the other hand, will benefit from increased trust and potentially higher customer footfall.While there may be initial hurdles, the long-term impact of this initiative promises to be positive. With cleaner, safer street food, everyone wins. From the enthusiastic customer to the dedicated vendor, a new era of hygienic and delicious roadside eats is on the horizon.Also Read: Delhi's Food Vans & E-Food Carts To Get Permanent Licences To Generate More RevenueThis targeted approach can ensure a smoother transition and a wider acceptance of the new licencing system.

A Sunday brunch is a time to relax, indulge, and enjoy a leisurely meal. There's no better way to elevate this experience than with a traditional Turkish kahvaltı. Turkish people have a strong love for food and believe that breakfast is the most significant meal of the day. Because of this, a traditional Turkish breakfast, or "kahvalti," is a feast for the senses.Turkish KahvaltiUnlike the hurried breakfasts common in many parts of the world, Turkish breakfast is a leisurely affair, often enjoyed with family and friends over several hours. The table becomes a gathering place where conversations flow as freely as the tea, creating an atmosphere of connection and relaxation. Turkish breakfast is usually enjoyed around a low table, either in a cosy kitchen or on a shaded terrace. The table is typically covered with colourful, patterned cloth. The communal nature of the meal fosters a sense of togetherness and reflects the Turkish value of sharingFreshness is a hallmark of Turkish breakfast. For instance, a typical Turkish breakfast consists of several small treats. Thus, black and green olives, cucumbers, cured meats, dips and sauces, eggs, fresh cheeses, fresh tomatoes, freshly baked bread, fruit preserves and jams, honey, pastries, and sweet butter are typically found in a traditional Turkish breakfast. The traditional beverage to accompany breakfast is Turkish tea (çay), served in small, tulip-shaped glasses. Strong and black, it’s usually sweetened with sugar. In some regions, ayran (a yoghurt-based drink) is also popular.  The variety ensures a good mix of proteins, healthy fats, and vitamins.While traditional elements remain central, modern Turkish breakfasts have started incorporating international flavours and ingredients. It’s not uncommon to find avocado toast, smoothies, or granola alongside the more traditional fare, especially in urban areas and trendy cafes.Also Read: 9 Restaurants In Bangalore, Delhi & Mumbai That Serve Delicious Authentic Turkish CuisineWhere To Have Kahvalti In India?  A post shared by Öz by Kebapçi (@oz.kebapci)The majority of people believe that you can only taste a meal at its best in its original location.
