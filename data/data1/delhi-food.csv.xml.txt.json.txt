If you went to a bar in Delhi over the weekend and couldn’t get your hands on your favourite beer, then sadly it isn’t just a one-time thing! Many prominent clubs and restaurants in the city have reported that there is a shortage of beer at warehouses in Delhi. Not just beer, they are also struggling to find some other popular spirits like whisky and tequila. This shortage of spirit in the city is affecting business and shifting patronage to neighbouring states like Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.Popular Beer Brands Missing In Delhi Since April[caption id="attachment_644672" align="alignnone" width="770"] Image Courtesy: Canva (representative image)[/caption]Many Delhi restaurants and bars have reported that there is a shortage of beer in the city. Many popular beer brands have been missing from Delhi bars, clubs, restaurants, and liquor stores since April. However, as per a report in The Times of India (TOI), the situation has worsened in the last few days. According to the report, this scarcity of beer has led to an overall drop in sales at liquor stores, prominent clubs and bars, and even restaurants in Delhi.As per Delhi restaurateurs, not just beer but other popular spirits were also not available at Delhi warehouses. Due to this shortage, they have seen a massive customer base shift to the bars and clubs in neighbouring states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.While talking to TOI, a Delhi restaurant owner explained that to procure liquor stock, the restaurant/bar has to place an order on a portal run by the excise department. However, when they try to place an order for beer, they get a “warehouse closed” alert on the portal. He then went on to mention that the issue has been persisting since April and has worsened over the last few days.Also Read: 7 New Restaurants In Delhi NCR To Head To This MonthWhat Is Causing This Beer Shortage In Delhi?[caption id="attachment_644674" align="alignnone" width="770"] Image Courtesy: Canva (representative image)[/caption]Well, the cause of this shortage is still unknown as there has been no reaction available from Delhi’s excise department.

The dining landscape in Delhi elicits varied opinions and sentiments. Within the city, one can encounter many culinary choices, ranging from delectable roadside momos to opulent fine dining establishments. However, locating a venue that truly captivates and exceeds expectations can prove challenging amidst this abundance. Yet, I found myself pleasantly surprised during a recent visit to Gurugram's latest sensation, Marièta. This exclusive, reservation-only restaurant had piqued my interest ever since I stumbled upon its enticing cocktail menu, offering an array of options perfectly suited to a tequila aficionado like myself.Marièta’s Immersive Ambiance, A Feast For The Senses[caption id="attachment_627393" align="alignnone" width="770"] Photo Credits: Mallika Khurana[/caption]The jam-packed, only months into its inception, etched a lasting memory in my mind. The atmosphere here pulses with infectious beats and the dynamic rhythm of tropical and Latin house music, setting a tone for the evening that lies ahead. Luxurious sage green interiors, adorned with a captivating mural featuring Marièta herself, demand attention. A gracefully sculpted bar, thought-provoking artworks illustrating Marièta's narrative, soft lighting, and an intimate dining enclave all contribute to the ambiance, evoking the embracing warmth of Latin hospitality. Boasting over 100 seats, encompassing both indoor and al fresco options, Marièta provides ample space for patrons to indulge in its vibrant ambiance. Yet, amidst these captivating features, it is not the exquisitely crafted bar that takes centre stage, but rather a stunning mural adorning the wall.Indulging In Exquisite Flavours[caption id="attachment_627392" align="alignnone" width="770"] Photo Credits: Mallika Khurana[/caption]Looking at the tempting menu, I found myself overwhelmed with choices and eager to sample everything. Starting modestly, I opted for Hummus with Pita, Tofu Karaage, and Burrata & Tomato Salad. Accompanying my meal, I indulged in Heat Check, a spicy tequila creation and their World Cocktail Week Special, the Grey Goose Espresso Martini. While the salad provided a refreshing burst of flavours and the crispy tofu won me over, a single sip of the espresso martini hinted at the exceptional mixology awaiting me. However, it was the Heat Check that truly delivered, fulfilling every checkbox for a perfect tequila cocktail with its impeccable balance of spice.Excited to explore bolder flavours, I opted for Marieta’s Chilli Chicken, which proved to be a satisfying choice. Alongside, I indulged in Korean Chicken Skewers generously coated in bibimbap sauce, a true culinary masterpiece. These skewers melted in my mouth, boasting a perfect balance of flavours—a first-time experience for me. Undoubtedly, it stands out as one of Marièta's finest dishes, deserving a spot on every diner's must-try list!Also Read: CTReview: I Visited Blanca, Delhi’s Newest Gastronomic Wonderland; Here’s What Tempted My Taste Buds!Feasting On Culinary Masterpieces[caption id="attachment_627391" align="alignnone" width="770"] Photo Credits: Mallika Khurana[/caption]Next, I was yearning for a sushi fix and opted for their Torched Seafood Overload Uramaki featuring Tuna, salmon, togarashi crab mix, and tobiko, alongside their Crispy Asparagus & Togarashi Mayo. Both dishes were superbly crafted and utterly delightful. Additionally, I indulged in their impeccably juicy and flavourful Habanero Butter Shrimp, accompanied by garlic slivers, basil, and sourdough bread, paired with the most visually stunning cocktail of the evening, the Second Date. Comprising tequila Blanco, sake, kaffir lime, lychee, jasmine tea, orange blossom, and agave, this libation not only pleased the eyes but also tantalised my inner tequila enthusiast. Pro tip: don’t miss out on the experience of dipping sourdough into the Habanero butter sauce. Eager to explore another offering from their World Cocktail Week Special, I savoured the Patrón Reposado Picante. For aficionados of spicy cocktails like myself, the Picante is an absolute must-try!For the main course, I opted for their Chipotle Sea Bass, a seared sea bass fillet resting on a delightful bed of pan-tossed quinoa and millet, accompanied by chipotle butter, which was satisfactory. However, it was the Red Thai Curry Rice Bowl with tofu and veggies that truly stole the spotlight.Highlight Of The Marièta Experience[caption id="attachment_627390" align="alignnone" width="770"] Photo Credits: Mallika Khurana[/caption]After relishing an impeccably delicious spread, I was ready to call it a night. However, the gracious staff at Marièta insisted I sample a dessert, and I'm immensely grateful that I did. It turned out to be the highlight of my entire dining experience. Saving the best for last, they presented me with the Picante Chocolate, a culinary masterpiece that would compel me to travel to Gurugram at the earliest opportunity. As someone who typically shies away from desserts, this is a significant endorsement. Yet, the explosion of flavours from the Chilli chocolate cremeux, pineapple compote, and brandy left me utterly captivated. It wasn't merely a concoction of overwhelming sweetness, but rather a delicate balance of subtle spice and a touch of brandy. This dessert epitomised perfection and tantalised all my senses. Marièta is unequivocally a must-visit for anyone who values exceptional food and superb cocktails.PS.

In India, chai is more than just a beverage; it's a cultural phenomenon, an elixir that binds people together. From city streets to rural landscapes, chai stalls are omnipresent, serving as social hubs where stories are shared, and connections are forged. Today, we delve into the world of chai through the lens of a revered connoisseur, Laxman Rao, who transformed his humble tea-selling beginnings into an illustrious career, becoming a consultant for the prestigious Shangri-La Eros New Delhi.Laxman Rao, From Sidewalk Tea-Seller To Literary Luminary[caption id="attachment_623563" align="alignnone" width="770"] Photo Credits: Press Release[/caption]Laxman Rao is an extraordinary figure whose journey from a roadside tea seller to an internationally recognised master of chai and award-winning author is nothing short of inspirational. Rao, a graduate of Delhi University, has authored over 24 novels, plays, and political essays. His works are praised for their honesty and humility, weaving tales that reflect the ground realities of life. We had the unique opportunity to speak with him about his life, his journey, his chai, and more.Rao's journey began at a humble tea stall on Vishnu Digambar Marg near ITO in Delhi, where he sold tea for over three decades. "Many people who visited my stall were intrigued that a chai walla could also write and sell books," Rao recalls. This dual identity intrigued his customers and fueled his literary creativity. His books often draw from the diverse stories of his customers, capturing the essence of their personal struggles and triumphs. "I draw inspiration from the myriad stories present in the lives of my guests," Rao explains. This rich tapestry of human experience has been a cornerstone of his work.Crafting The Perfect Cup Of Chai[caption id="attachment_623562" align="alignnone" width="770"] Photo Credits: Press Release[/caption]Rao emphasises the meticulous process involved when asked about what differentiates his chai from others. "Chai preparation, while seemingly simple, requires careful attention to detail to achieve the perfect flavour," he says. Rao describes the steps: bringing water to a boil, adding the right amount of tea leaves, and allowing the mixture to simmer to release the tea's full aroma and flavour. The final step is boiling the chai after adding milk and sugar, ensuring the ingredients meld together harmoniously.Rao's work has gained recognition both in India and abroad. He expresses his gratitude for this international acclaim, saying, "Seeing my story in newspapers and knowing that Indians resonate with my ideologies is truly gratifying. Being talked about internationally is a fortunate and humbling experience for me." This recognition underscores the universal appeal of his journey and the profound impact of his work on people from different cultural backgrounds.Also Read: CTExclusive: Michelin Star Chef David Thompson’s Promises The World ‘Full Undiluted And Traditional Flavours Of Thai’Chai As A Medium Of Human Connection[caption id="attachment_623561" align="alignnone" width="770"] Photo Credits: Press Release[/caption]Beyond its taste, chai holds a significant place in fostering connections and creating cherished memories. "Chai becomes more than just a beverage; it is a medium through which emotions are rediscovered and social bonds are strengthened," Rao reflects. He recalls his childhood excitement when a Brooke Bond tea-selling van visited his village, highlighting the deep-rooted cultural significance of chai.Reflecting on his life and career, Rao hopes his legacy will be defined by the lasting impact he has made on both tea culture and the literary world. "While I was relentlessly following my passion, a senior leader from Shangri-La Eros in New Delhi found me, captivated by the fragrance and comfort of my tea," he shares. Rao's seamless blend of his passion for chai with his career as a writer is evident in his unique approach.

Aerocity at Indira Gandhi International Airport is preparing to open India's largest mall by 2027. The enormous building will cover more than 2.8 million square feet. The ambitious project is a component of the larger Worldmark Aerocity expansion initiative, which is valued at $2.5 billion. The goal of this expansion is to build India's first aerotropolis, or bustling urban centre centred around the airport, not just a mall. India's Largest Mall To Aerocity By 2027[caption id="attachment_615852" align="alignnone" width="770"] Photo Credits: Canva[/caption]It is anticipated that this aerotropolis will grow eight times over the next five years, according to The Times of India. Aerocity currently has 1.5 million square feet of leasable space available; however, in two phases by 2029, this is expected to be increased to over 10 million square feet. This covers not just stores but also public spaces, food courts, and offices.As per the Business Standard reports, 6.5 million square feet of additional leasable space will be added to Aerocity's global business district, bringing the total area to 18 million square feet. The responsibility for this grand development falls on Bharti Realty, awarded the project by Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL), backed by GMR. While the state maintains ownership, Bharti Realty's lease for Aerocity is in line with DIAL's lease for airport development and operations. According to SK Sayal, MD and CEO of Bharti Realty, phase 2 and 3 of Aerocity's expansion will require a substantial $2.5 billion investment, financed through a combination of debt and equity. Phase 2 is set to begin next year and will feature Worldmark 4, 5, 6, and 7, as well as the largest mall in India, spanning 2.8 million square feet and dwarfing the current malls in Vasant Kunj. More than 8,000 parking spaces will be available underground. Furthermore, Aerocity's hotel infrastructure is expected to expand significantly. After Phase 2 is finished, the city's 5,000 hotel rooms spread across 11 hotels will increase to 7,000 rooms spread across 16 hotels.Also Read: For Election Day, Gurugram Multiplexes Offer Special Discounts For Inked Finger-Voters On 25 MayDrawing Millions Into Its Fold[caption id="attachment_615851" align="alignnone" width="770"] Photo Credits: Canva[/caption]Even the biggest companies are drawn to Aerocity. Airbus, EY, and Emirates are just a few of the companies that have expressed interest in Phase 1. Meanwhile, Brookfield, a multinational investment firm, has taken a majority share in Bharti's commercial properties, which includes Aerocity Worldmark Phase 1. In the future, Aerocity is expected to attract at least 30 million visitors annually and develop into a hub for 2 million professionals. TWith its projected growth, IGI Airport could handle over 100 million passengers a year, possibly requiring the much larger Terminal 4 to be built in place of Terminal 2. DIAL is building India's first interstate multi-modal transport hub close to the Aerocity metro station to handle this increase in activity, according to the Business Standard.The configuration of the proposed air train, which would connect Terminal 1 with Terminal 3/2 (or Terminal 4, depending on future developments), is still up for discussion between DIAL and the Union Aviation Ministry. Cover Image Courtesy: Canva (Representative image)
