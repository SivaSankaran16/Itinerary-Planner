The room is alive with a symphony of colours and sounds, as if you've stepped into a vibrant, otherworldly dimension. This isn't just dinner; it's an immersive dining experience unlike anything you've ever encountered before. Welcome to 'Le Petit Chef & Friends' at Shangri-La Eros New Delhi.

The fiery PequenÃÉa Maria hailing from the vibrant streets of Spain, the charming Piccolo Luciano bringing the essence of Italy to life, and the meticulous Chisano Takahiro represented the culinary prowess of Japan.¬†As I settled into my seat, the lights dimmed, signalling the start of the show. The room came alive with the vibrant energy of the petit chefs and their friends, projected on my table through innovative 3D mapping technology. It was like stepping into a magical world. The introduction of the chefs was captivating, setting the stage for the culinary journey that lay ahead. We were not just invited to enjoy the flavours but also to witness a thrilling virtual cooking competition unfold before our very eyes. With exclusive props adorning the stage and live hosts guiding the proceedings, every moment is infused with drama and excitement. Who will emerge victorious and claim the coveted 'Golden Hat' award?
