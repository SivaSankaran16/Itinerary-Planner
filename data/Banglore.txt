IPL is back again but this is not your regular IPL screening! This is a place where nature, comfort and IPL amalgamate. This is an extremely unique experience; to watch IPL match under the stars with your boo or friends in an open-air theatre, wow! Relax and get cosy at the glamping tents with snackable bites. After the IPL match, there is a night tent stay, a campfire by the lake and dinner. Isn‚Äôt that a cool event in Bangalore? Cricket lovers should definitely book this.

X User Posts About Booking Pune-Bengaluru Flight For ‚Çπ3,500 & Uber For ‚Çπ2,000; Internet Say, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Bengaluru For You!‚Äù

A woman took to X (formerly Twitter) to share how her cab ride from Bengaluru airport to home cost her ‚Çπ2,000, after flying from Pune for ‚Çπ3,500.

Surcharged cab prices are nothing new. From peak-hour surcharges to late-night service surcharges, cab companies have it all! However, how would you feel if your cab fare costs more than half of the airfare while travelling back from the airport? Well, that‚Äôs exactly what happened with a woman who was flying from Pune to Bengaluru. She took to X (formerly Twitter) to share how her flight cost her ‚Çπ3,500, while her Uber from the Bengaluru airport to home cost her ‚Çπ2,000! When Uber Ride In Bengaluru Costed More Than Half The Flight Price

We usually think that air travel is expensive. But after seeing @manasvisharmaaa post on X (formerly Twitter), it seems like cab rides can give them tough competition. In a now-viral post, @manasvisharmaaa shared a screenshot from her Uber app that showed her cab fare of ‚Çπ2,005 from Bengaluru Airport to her home. In her post, she mentioned that her Pune to Bengaluru flight accounted for ‚Çπ3,500. This basically means that her cab fare is more than half of her air ticket cost! She wrote in her post, ‚ÄúI booked a flight for 3.5k from Pune to Bangalore. And then, a cab for 2k from Bangalore airport to my home.‚Äù She also tagged Uber‚Äôs official X handle in the post.

Image Courtesy: Canva & X/@manasvisharmaaa The Internet, of course, had a lot to say about these atrocious surcharged fares by Uber. There were more than a thousand comments on these posts. Many people shared similar incidents while some gave alternatives that one can use in Bengaluru.

Atrocious. I was noticing this last month ‚Äì Bengaluru to Chennai was ‚Çπ 1799 and HSR to KIA was ‚Çπ 2000+ ridiculous surge pricing. I just decided to plan 3 hrs ahead and take the bus.

12:19 AM!! i picked the cab around 11:30 yesterday had to wait 30 mins first of all, initially it showed 1350 something, and after the trip ended it showed 1850. Full scam they are running. I think they were increasing 200 ruppees per hour or something. ‚Äî CamaRMD (@CamaSlinga) April 1, 2024

Bengaluru Woman‚Äôs Quirky Flatmate Hunting Post Goes Viral; Netizens Say, ‚ÄúAd Better Than The Home‚Äù

Netizens are enjoying the uniqueness and creativity represented in this post.

by Shreya Ghosh Updated: February 28, 2024

Share

Adulthood comes with a lot of struggles and one of the biggest ones is to shift to an all-new city, look for a place to transform it into a home, and search for a trustworthy roommate. Seems like a major task, right? Well, with proper communication and a little bit of hard work, even the toughest job becomes a bit easier. Recently, a woman in Bengaluru made a flatmate hunting post about looking for a roommate in Kormangala. And in no time, it became viral. Bengaluru Woman Found A Unique Approach To Find A Roomie Taking to the microblogging site, udisha (@puffyter) shared a simple post to search for a roommate for a 2BHK flat. Little did she know that some creative elements added to the post would actually turn out to be oh-so-viral overnight. Let‚Äôs take a look at the reasons behind all the hype.

üîàüîàFlatmate Alert! Hey folks! I‚Äôm looking for a female flatmate for my 2BHK in 8th Block, Koramangala, at a 5-minute walk from DYU Art Cafe. Rent ‚Äì 13,750 pp Deposit ‚Äì 50k Move-in date ‚Äì 1st April Please repost for visibility & DM for deets! @BangaloreRoomi @peakbengaluru üåû pic.twitter.com/8ctJDznwVp ‚Äî udisha (@puffyter) February 26, 2024

It is so important to present the room perfectly and share beautiful pictures of all corners while posting on social media platforms. Well, looks like all of us need to take some tips from Udisha as her recent post on X is grabbing attention for all the right reasons. Sharing basic information about her 2BHK flat in Koramangala‚Äôs 8th Block, she shared a few pictures as well. From introducing herself and mentioning how she is looking for a flatmate for her 2BHK house to showing different corners of her home, she represented the pictures so aesthetically. Out of all the impressive elements of this viral post, we loved how she made collages of everything in her home and added aesthetic fonts to describe the areas as well. Koramangala is Bengaluru‚Äôs bustling neighbourhood and the rent here is also not the most affordable one in the market. Udisha‚Äôs post about renting her 2BHK for just ‚Çπ13,750 has surprised everyone. Also read: Bengaluru Traffic Sign Misinterpreted As &#8216;Follow Someone Home&#8217;. Netizens: &#8220;Does It Promote Stalking?&#8221; Netizens Are Impressed By This Flatmate Hunting Post! Shared only on February 26, it did not take much time for the X post to go viral. With almost 170K views on the post, X users are showering appreciation and praise for her unique approach to looking for a flatmate. From applauding her skills and efforts to search for a roomie to calling the post one of the best flatmate pitches, the comments under the viral post are supportive and simply amazing.

Sunil Chhetri Recommends These 3 Restaurants In Bangalore For Foodies

Sunil Chhetri loves authentic South Indian food, sushi, hibachi rice, and tandoori dishes.

by Ankita Mazumdar Updated: December 19, 2023

Share

Indian Football Captain, Sunil Chhetri, joined us on the episode of Sunday Brunch with our Editor-in-Chief, Kamiya Jani. During the interview, he mentioned that his home is in Bangalore now, with his cute little family. He even criticised Banglore for having really bad traffic but also said that he loves the city despite it. However, he was able to give us some great food place recommendations in Bangalore and we were hyped about it. Sunil Chhetri Suggested 3 Bangalore Restaurants

While we were on the topic of Bangalore, we weren‚Äôt gonna miss out on getting some good food recommendation places from the person who has been living in Bangalore for over a decade now. Kamiya asked Sunil Chhetri, ‚ÄúAcha aap mujhe baatiyen, main Bangalore mein hoon ek hi din ke liye, toh aap kya kya recommend karenge. Main kaha kaha jayun Bangalore mein? ‚Äù She was simply asking for recommendations as it was a one-day trip to Bangalore. Sunil Chhetri cutely went on to facepalm and answered us that he was actually the wrong person to ask this question. This made Kamiya laugh out loud and she questioned him about his frequency of outings. Then he gave us these food recommendation places. He suggested Airlines which is in the heart of the city and serves South Indian cuisine. He even told us they serve some great Dosa, Idli and Filter Coffee. What he also liked about Airlines is that it has a great ambiance and is within walking distance from his place. Hmm, we see you are avoiding travelling in Bangalore and being stuck in traffic. Also Read: Sunil Chhetri Says, ‚ÄúMinus The Traffic, I Like Everything About Bangalore‚Äù Bangaloreans Agree Next, Sunil Chhetri told us about Shiro from where they order sushi and he adores a dish called Hibachi Rice. Lastly, he recommended ITC‚Äôs The Royal Afghan. Even while mentioning this restaurant, it seemed like he remembered some delectable food items from The Royal Afghan. We definitely have to go here. He said their food is, and we‚Äôre quoting here, ‚Äúlazeez khana‚Äù and that they serve massive portions of food. So much so that you might have to skip meals for two to three days! His Cheat Meals Are Pre-Planned!

Image Credits: Internal Sunil Chhetri also mentioned during the interview that his cheat meals were pre-planned. We all have question marks on the top of our heads and are a tad bit guilty of eating everything in sight. Upon further explanation, we got to know that he sets benchmarks for his cheat meals. Sunil Chhetri told us that if he had a football match with a particular team after 15 days and if he won that match, he would be eligible to enjoy his cheat meals. It‚Äôs just not that, the timings and people who he will have cheat meals with are fixed. He is a very strict person when it comes to his body and his game and we appreciate that. In the end, he told us that during cheat meals, he just goes all out and gorges a little too much. Well, he deserves it!

X User Asks AI To Generate ‚ÄúWorse‚Äù Bengaluru Traffic Images; Netizens Say, ‚ÄúYe Toh Reality Hai‚Äù

An Internet user asked ChatGPT to curate images of Bengaluru traffic in different situations.

by Shreya Ghosh Updated: November 29, 2023

Share

Bengaluru is famous for several reasons. Be it the hub of endless IT companies or the soothing weather and fresher air, there are tons of aspects behind the city being so popular among Indians. One of the infamous things about the city that everyone is tired of but still cannot get away from is the unbearable traffic. From locals to tourists, everyone who has experienced the mad vehicular congestion can surely relate to what I am talking about. A Netizen used AI to generate some pictures of the city traffic and most of these look so on point. AI Curated These Pictures Depicting Bengaluru Traffic In Different Situations Taking to the X (formerly Twitter) platform, Halli Billy (@halli_billy) asked ChatGPT to generate different images of congested roads and traffic in the Karnataka capital. The user provided different instances to get results of different depictions of traffic chaos in the city.

Yes we‚Äôre doing this. Bengaluru traffic getting progressively worse with likes pic.twitter.com/EZoxnfCZ61 ‚Äî Halli Billy (@halli_billy) November 28, 2023

For the first image, he asked AI to ‚Äúgenerate an image of vehicular traffic in Bengaluru‚Äù and the previous tweet is the result. The image represents vehicular traffic and ‚Äúcaptures the lively and chaotic atmosphere of a busy street in the city‚Äù. For the next image, he asked AI to ‚ÄúMake it worse‚Äù.

This one for free pic.twitter.com/9fOLftEkj4 ‚Äî Halli Billy (@halli_billy) November 28, 2023

This AI-curated image shows more number of vehicles on the street. From buses to autos to cars to two-wheelers, there are different vehicles. The user wanted some more congestion in the images. That‚Äôs why he mentioned, ‚ÄúTHIS IS NOTHING. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO THE CITY?? MAKE IT 10X WORSE‚Äù.

Showing my zirp era startup worker mindset pic.twitter.com/GbvEK5MUos ‚Äî Halli Billy (@halli_billy) November 28, 2023

The result is a more exaggerated depiction of vehicular traffic with ‚Äúa visually cluttered urban landscape‚Äù, replied ChatGPT. Also read: Bengaluru‚Äôs 70-YO New Krishna Bhavan To Close Doors; We‚Äôll Miss The Button Idlis &#038; Badam Halwa Well, to make it worse, the X user asked AI to add snippets of metro construction work as well.

Ohh yeaa pic.twitter.com/ID38H3CE33 ‚Äî Halli Billy (@halli_billy) November 28, 2023

The result captures the atmosphere of intense chaos of traffic on the roads of Bengaluru with vehicles coming from different directions and an ongoing metro construction beside all these traffic jams. For the next picture, the instruction was to add an under-construction flyover on another side of the congested road.

Getting there‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/1jdkfrLBVF ‚Äî Halli Billy (@halli_billy) November 28, 2023

The final image shows both metro construction and under-construction flyovers causing a major issue and crazy vehicular congestion. The next instruction is just on another level. The user asked AI to add some potholes on the smooth roads.

More feature requests pic.twitter.com/4zTr3RPC5X ‚Äî Halli Billy (@halli_billy) November 28, 2023

The picture surely looks a bit funny with all the scary potholes and vehicles in different places. For the next image, the request was to add more buses, cranes, cars, and trucks.

As requested by @abybaby_san pic.twitter.com/6dYXkBwrfg ‚Äî Halli Billy (@halli_billy) November 28, 2023

The AI-curated image depicts the chaotic urban scene in the city with a massive number of vehicles. The next instruction was to curate a worse traffic congestion but with a blissful weather.

Alignment achieved. Welcome to outer ring road ‚ù§Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/GyWnDnM1rp ‚Äî Halli Billy (@halli_billy) November 28, 2023

But this did not seem enough. The user asked ChatGPT to add 100X more traffic on the road and simply ‚ÄúGo nuts‚Äù.

Bonus #1. Getting serious pic.twitter.com/41vtSX6Gd8 ‚Äî Halli Billy (@halli_billy) November 28, 2023

For the next image, the user had a hilarious suggestion. He asked to make a close-packed otherworldly multi-dimensional cluster of worse traffic.

Okay I‚Äôm done. Good night pic.twitter.com/gDgAwjpERA ‚Äî Halli Billy (@halli_billy) November 28, 2023

pakoda is tired (@stressedpakoda) requested an AI image where people gather around to click pictures of pink flowers.

It‚Äôs missing the pink flowers of Bangalore that people get stuck in traffic to take photos of ‚Äî pakoda is tired (@stressedpakoda) November 28, 2023

Here you go pic.twitter.com/AO4h7OXHlK ‚Äî Halli Billy (@halli_billy) November 28, 2023

The result is quite apt. Isn‚Äôt it? Also read: Bengaluru Public Service Vehicles Asked To Install Tracking Devices With Panic Button By Nov 30, 2024 What Do Netizens Think? People are already very frustrated and tired with the city‚Äôs endless traffic and congestion in most places and they also agree with these AI images depicting the massive chaos on roads.

Fire Breaks Out At Bengaluru‚Äôs Mudpipe Cafe In Koramangala; Man Jumps Out Of Burning Building

Bangalore witnessed a horrifying incident in the city where a fire broke out in Mudpipe Cafe. It is a hookah cafe situated in the Koramangala area in Bangalore. Several videos started circulating the social media and the scene was chilling! Bangalore‚Äôs Mudpipe Cafe Caught Fire!

Reportedly Mudpipe Cafe (Hukkah bar), burnt down due to fire. Seems it‚Äôs because of cylinder blast. This is near nexus mall (forum Mall)#Koramangala #Bengaluru pic.twitter.com/zxBQZuORZh ‚Äî Masala Dose ‚Äì ‡≤Æ‡≤∏‡≤æ‡≤≤‡≥Ü ‡≤¶‡≥ã‡≤∏‡≥Ü (@DosaSpeaks) October 18, 2023

This afternoon, a large fire broke out in the Mudpipe Cafe located in the Koramangala area in Bangalore. One person who jumped from the building was hurt and taken to a nearby hospital by emergency vehicles. According to fire and rescue officials, they learned of the fire at 12:05 p.m. Eight vehicles have been put into service, including two water bowsers, five water tankers, and an aerial ladder platform (ALP).

According to a senior officer, the fourth-floor cafe of the four-story building was where the fire started. He further stated that a person inside the building jumped before they arrived, and the public hurried him to the hospital. The cafe was shut and the fire was followed by a blast. They needed to find out what triggered the explosion. The same structure housed a Nexa showroom and a Cult Fit gym. The entire top and second floors of the structure are now completely engulfed in flames.

Authorities believe that a short circuit caused the fire to start. It will, however, be too early to determine the cause, they claim. As soon as they arrived, the Suddaguntepalya police evacuated residents of nearby buildings. Further, an official claimed that the LPG gas cylinders were housed in the premises which raised suspicions about the explosion.

Also Read: CT Quickies: From Overcrowded Purple Metro Line To New Sleeper Buses, Bangalore Updates For You Earlier, in order to enforce a prohibition on hookah smoking in public areas, the government is now amending the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA), according to Health Minister Dinesh Gundu Rao. He made the announcement by saying that they were forbidding not hookah itself but rather using hookah in public places. It might be used at home without restriction. Dinesh Gundu Rao has previously claimed that the government was enforcing a ban because many hookah bars serve as drug entry points. Fire Incidents That Took Place In India

Attibele Fire Tragedy As of Wednesday morning, one more victim had passed away from his injuries, bringing the total number of fatalities in the Attibele fire disaster to 17.

According to hospital officials, Naveen Reddy, the third culprit in the case and son of the owner of the firecracker shop, is still receiving treatment in the burns unit and is in stable condition. 2. Matunga Car Fire Accidents On Monday morning in Mumbai, two brothers were killed and three others were hurt when the car they were riding in caught fire. According to officials, the incident happened at around 4:00 am on B A Road in the Matunga neighbourhood when the CNG car‚Äôs occupants were taking a joyride following a party and hit a road divider. The car‚Äôs occupants did not have time to exit the vehicle before it quickly caught fire. Later, some locals called the police and fire departments, who came right away.

Call Them Traffic Jams Or Dates On The Go? Bengaluru Resident Suggests A Unique Dating Strategy

by Mallika Khurana Updated: October 9, 2023

Share

In the midst of the never-ending traffic jams that define Bengaluru, a Bengaluru resident has sparked a novel dating idea. She has chosen an unusual route to romance, making gridlock and long commutes into unexpected opportunities for connection and companionship. In spite of the honking horns and traffic, Bengaluru‚Äôs persistent traffic woes have become a regular feature in the news. However, this resident has found a way to make the city‚Äôs dating scene more interesting. Confused? Let us elaborate on the innovative idea! Bengaluru Resident Suggested Turning Traffic Into Romance

Bangalore dating tip: Try meeting earlier and commute together to your favourite spot during peak traffic hours. This way, you‚Äôll get to spend much more time together and you‚Äôll also find out if they have any anger issues. ‚Äî Prakriti (@prakritipsy) October 6, 2023

On X (formerly known as Twitter), a user and resident of Bengaluru, Prakriti, shared an unusual dating tip that has captured the imagination of many. Her idea is refreshingly unconventional: ‚ÄúWhy not schedule your meetings a tad earlier and navigate the city‚Äôs peak traffic together?‚Äù This innovative strategy not only provides extra quality time but also offers a glimpse into your companion‚Äôs temperament under the pressure of traffic snarls. What better way to ensure your compatibility with another individual?

In a world where numerous dating apps rarely succeed in getting us genuine connections and busy lives stop us from taking it forward when we finally match with someone, this idea of dating during peak traffic hours is simply brilliant. Naturally, the response to Prakriti‚Äôs suggestion was a delightful blend of curiosity and humour from the online community.

Turning Gridlock Into Love While some people considered it to be an efficient compatibility test, others remembered the days when carpooling was not banned and we could ride with strangers. Many called this traffic dating idea a brilliant one and really wanted to give it a shot, but there were some who weren‚Äôt as convinced. One user even compared the idea with the concept of arranged marriage.

Bengaluru Landlord Rejects Tenant For Not Scoring 90% In Class 12

by Shreya Ghosh Updated: April 28, 2023

Share

The stress of shifting to a new city and finding a place to live is so real! So many youngsters move to major cities like Bengaluru every year for studying or starting a new job. And they need to go through an entire cycle of struggle for house hunting. With every passing day, the criteria of each landlord are increasing here. With a huge increase in the monthly rent and security deposits, these property owners are also conducting proper interviews with write-ups and all. Asking for their LinkedIn profile and getting to know them well is fine to some extent, but what happened with a potential tenant in this city will simply surprise you. This Landlord Just Rejected A Tenant Because Of The Most Unnecessary Reason A Twitter user named Shubh who goes by the username @kadaipaneeeer shared an incident about his cousin Yogesh looking for a rented flat. Though his cousin found a property and was a potential tenant, unfortunately, he got rejected by the owner. The reason for denying to rent him the flat just does not make any sense.

‚ÄúMarks don‚Äôt decide your future, but it definitely decides whether you get a flat in banglore or not‚Äù pic.twitter.com/L0a9Sjms6d ‚Äî Shubh (@kadaipaneeeer) April 27, 2023

Also read: Landlords Don&#8217;t Wanna Rent Out Flats To Bachelors? Well, It&#8217;s Because Of Such Bachelors! According to the shared screenshots in the tweet, the owner of the property approved Yogesh‚Äôs profile in the beginning. The landlord also asked the broker that the potential tenant needs to share his LinkedIn/ Twitter profile, a copy of his joining certificate, 10th-12th mark sheet, Aadhar card, and pan card. Not just these, he was also asked to provide a 150-200 words write-up about himself. Unfortunately, his profile was rejected later simply because he scored 76% in Class 12. The landlord is expecting someone who has scored at least 90% in Class 12.

https://t.co/NbW28W44Bt ‚Äî Shubh (@kadaipaneeeer) April 27, 2023

Tweeple Cannot Take This Anymore! Netizens could not control themselves from laughing out loud after hearing the most hilarious response from the Bengaluru landlord. Many Twitter users are planning to shift to Bengaluru soon or sometime in the near future but not everyone has scored 90% or above in class 12. And now they are joking about how they will also not find a flat in the city! The responses are simply hysterical and completely meme-worthy!

Anushka Sharma & Virat Kohli Visit Shri Sagar CTR & Corner House For A Lunch In Bangalore!

by Anupriya Mishra Updated: April 23, 2023

Share

When you think of a crispy and butter-y masala dosa that‚Äôs filled with lip-smacking potatoes, the first name that probably pops up in your mind is that of Shri Sagar CTR. Known for offering what‚Äôs touted to be the best Benne Dosa in town, this eatery hardly needs any introductions to Bangloreans. And it seems the fan base extends to the ace cricketer Virat Kholi and Bollywood actress, Anushka Sharma. The two recently went to the restaurant after taking out some time off from their hectic schedule! Here‚Äôs all about their lunch at the popular eatery. Anushka Sharma & Virat Kohli Visit Shri Sagar CTR

Pic credits: Instagram/anushkasharma Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli took some time off their hectic schedule to enjoy a mouth-watering lunch at the iconic Shri Sagar CTR in Bangalore. Known for serving what‚Äôs touted to be the best Benne Dosa, it seems Anushka Sharma also had to order the same at the restaurant. We got a glimpse of what she ordered and her experience at this legendary Banglore eatery through her Instagram stories. From the glimpse, it seems she also ordered Mangalore Bajji or Goli Bajji and Rava Kesarbath. And to be honest, these dishes looked absolutely tempting! Also Read: Janhvi Kapoor Enjoys &#8220;Breakfast Of Champions&#8221;. This Is What She Eats! They Also Made A Pit Stop At Corner House!

Pic credits: Instagram/anushkasharma As it happens, the actress also posted a photo with her family on the story and the official account of the restaurant also share a pic from their visit! In her stories, the actress seems to have also enjoyed a sundae from Corner House in Bangalore. And for those of you who have an insatiable sweet tooth, this humble ice cream shop hardly needs any introductions. Looks like these two had an absolutely fantastic day and enjoyed a mouth-watering lunch. Talking about Corner House, this humble shop has been whipping up delicious desserts since 1982 and Shri Sagar CTR is a little restaurant that serves a mouth-watering array of dishes. Both are located in Bangalore and are popular among the locals for their exemplary food and services. So, what are your favourites at these two restaurants?
