The bustling Pune nightlife has come to a standstill after the unfortunate Porsche Incident in the city. An X (formerly Twitter) user posted videos of some popular pubs in the city that appear empty even on the weekend. He pointed out how the pubs have also become stricter with their ID checking and are exercising greater caution in following the law. Read on to know more. X User Shares Videos Of Deserted Pubs In Pune After The Porsche Incident

Pune clubs are empty. The crowd that used to party the most (high school kids and college kids) are not even being allowed to enter. They have stopped serving alcohol in the clubs except near the bar area. Even 40-50 years old people are being asked to show IDs for entry. — Chirag Barjatya (@chiragbarjatyaa) May 27, 2024

X (formerly Twitter) user, @chiragbarjatyaa, posted videos of pubs in Pune over the weekend. The once bustling places hardly saw any crowd over the weekend after the Porsche incident took the city by storm. According to his post, “Pune clubs are empty. The crowd that used to party the most (high school kids and college kids) are not even being allowed to enter.”

One of the Most famous club of Pune on Saturday brunch. Empty!! In usual (non strict) era, you won’t even get a space to stand here. How are they going to pay rent this month. pic.twitter.com/qXQIojmT7m — Chirag Barjatya (@chiragbarjatyaa) May 27, 2024

He went on to mention how the restaurant and club owners have become strict and are checking IDs before serving alcoholic beverages. He mentioned, “They have stopped serving alcohol in the clubs except near the bar area. Even 40-50 year old people are being asked to show IDs for entry.”

RIP situation! pic.twitter.com/MASVRhzWWA — Chirag Barjatya (@chiragbarjatyaa) May 27, 2024

He had posted videos of two clubs in Pune that appear deserted to prove how the unfortunate incident has affected the city and also the businesses of the people here.

Image Courtesy: Canva (representative image) The post by @chiragbarjatyaa received hundreds of comments with people sharing their two cents and their own recent experiences at the pubs in the city. Here are some comments you cannot miss out on.

So apparently these clubs were flourishing by serving alcohol to minors. Thanks for the implication — Matt Roolz (@mattrulzz) May 28, 2024

The effect has spread over to Mumbai too. I was asked my ID yesterday at a bar with the waiter explaining to me that the restaurants here are scared of a crackdown. — Hedgemaster (@mr_hedgemaster) May 27, 2024

I hope this strictness lasts. — Pankti Mehta (@PanktiMehta24) May 27, 2024

Past friday went for team dinner in an open air roof top club. Wasn’t open air no more, no drinks served outside, no music playing. Was the last to enter, showed my ID, even with all my greys was asked my age. Good job there!! But, ID has my DOB ages pre 2k. Mental math?? — ScandalousGrace (@ScandlousGrace) May 27, 2024

In India, we always need something bad to happen just to teach a lesson and take measures…. — Shubham Trivedi (@ShubhamTrivedii) May 27, 2024

ID Verification is very strict in NYC clubs & bars and should be very strict in India as well. Leniency many a times leads to accidents. — Karan Bhatia (@karanbhatia5757) May 27, 2024

Good changes — Manoj Hande (@Manoj_Hande) May 27, 2024

One accident changed many things Hope people take rules and regulations seriously from now on atleast & don’t forget this with time 🤞 — Veena Jain (@DrJain21) May 27, 2024

One accident changed many things Hope people take rules and regulations seriously from now on atleast & don’t forget this with time 🤞 — Veena Jain (@DrJain21) May 27, 2024

This should be the norm, not an exception for a short duration and go back to business as usual. — Kishore Kumar (@kk5kishore) May 28, 2024

The business will pick up. The effect is temporary in Pune but the tremors were felt in all Tier 1,2 and 3 cities. They have all started asking for ID’s. I wish they had practised this earlier, we would have not lost a lot of lives to gory accidents. — Situn Mohapatra (@SlipperyTweets) May 27, 2024

Nothing wrong with ID checks. This should be SOP. Doesn’t matter if they can or can’t pay the rent. Most of these are owned by super influential people. — gautam padmanabhan (@pgautam01) May 27, 2024

Turns out some places were always following the rules and checking IDs as recommended by the authorities.

Toit does not serve hard liqour without checking ID. Although I do not drink, below happened with my group. Have been there when I was 22 and after I’ve become 25, both the times an ID was asked by the attendant. — Varun Godse (@VarunGodse) May 27, 2024

I went here yesterday only with my friend she was not allowed to as not 25yrs , Tiot was my go to place to visit. — Abhay patil (@Abhaypa24615837) May 27, 2024

Toit is one of the few places that used to check IDs even before the incident. — Shubham (@thatsharmaboy) May 27, 2024

Some people raised some valid questions and points.

Does that mean that most pub goers were underage? Can’t think of any other rational reason. — Changu Mangu (@AntOnThePlanet) May 27, 2024

That is what I was thinking yesterday . Vibrant Pune night life is going to get screwed for a long time . This will lead to the mushrooming of illegal party places on the outskirts . — Rahul Saraf (@kongposhsaraf) May 27, 2024

Many people in the comments section also talked about how this was a temporary change and things will go back to normal soon. We believe that unsettling incidents like this are a wake-up call to society that should not be ignored. Every club and pub in the country should actively check IDs and see that underage drinking is promoted in their cities. What are your thoughts on this? Let us know in the comments.

Share

Punekars are getting concerned about the Zika virus as the city recently reported new cases. On Monday, two new cases have been detected. The total tally of patients testing positive for this virus in this city has reached six. With the virus spreading around the city, people are becoming alarmed and conscious. What are the latest updates on patients? How are their health conditions? Let’s find out the answers to these questions. New Zika Virus Cases Are Getting Detected In Pune

Picture credit- Canva According to a report by The Economic Times, the first two patients who were detected with Zika virus infection were a doctor and his daughter. Interestingly, the recent two positive patients and the 46-year-old doctor and his daughter belong to the same location in Pune. After the health officials were notified about the first two patients testing positive, they began to inspect the area well. To get better results, the officials also took samples from people in that area for testing and finding results. Currently, the total number of Zika virus-infected patients in Pune is 6. As the testings will increase, the number may rise as well. An official recently shared that 2 pregnant women were detected with this infection. One of them is from Erandwane and she tested positive on Friday, according to a report by the Deccan Herald. The next woman found her positive results on Monday. She is currently 12 weeks pregnant. The news of two pregnant women is indeed frightening considering their present health conditions. However, the good news is that they are not facing any symptoms of this infection and are doing fine too.

Dubai SpiceJet Flight Delayed For 4 Hours In Pune; Passengers Order Food Via Apps, Airline Serves Only Tea

Due to a massive delay of SpiceJet Dubai flight, they ended up getting hungry and had to order food via delivery apps!

by Anupriya Mishra Updated: June 14, 2024

When you decide to take a flight to travel to a new destination or visit a long-adored city, chances are you don’t think about your flight getting delayed, by minutes or even hours! However, sometimes due to a variety of reasons, flights do get delayed, leaving passengers travelling in the same frazzled. And something similar happened to passengers of a SpiceJet flight to Dubai, who were stranded at the Pune Airport. Due to a massive delay, they ended up getting hungry and had to order food via delivery apps! SpiceJet Dubai Flight Delayed For 4 Hours In Pune

Picture credits: Canva A SpiceJet flight, SG-51 was supposed to take off for Dubai at 8:50 PM on Wednesday. However, due to some issues, the flight ended up being four hours late. As a result, it was only able to take off at 1:15 AM on Thursday. And, due to this four-hour delay, passengers were left hungry while they waited for the flight to take off. In fact, some passengers ended up ordering food via delivery apps after the airline just offered them a cup of tea. As revealed in a report in the Times of India, it was mentioned that a section of flyers had asked ground staffers, if they would get their ordered food. One of the passengers mentioned that a few employees did agree to fetch them food from the departure area. However, the airline did not provide any refreshments.

Picture credits: Canva At this point, it’s worth mentioning that the guidelines of the Director General of Civil Aviation mention that the airline is supposed to serve refreshments to flyers if the flight is delayed over two hours. Since there is only a stall of snacks and beverages at the international lounge of Pune Airport, many people resorted to ordering from outside. It should be noted that a master concessionaire has been finalised for the new terminal building. For this, the contract has also been awarded and there will be a total of 20 food and beverage outlets in both domestic and international security hold areas. Not to mention, two of the five lounges will be in the international area as well. This was revealed in the same report by the Pune Airport Director, Santosh Dhoke.

People of Navi Mumbai, we have fantastic news for you! Navi Mumbai International Airport will open its doors to the public sooner than expected. The much-awaited airport will kickstart its operations next year, after the completion of the construction of its premises. The project will be ready by March 2025. Navi Mumbai International Airport Is Set To Start Operations In March 2025 Taking to the X Platform, Arindam Mahapatra (@Maha7Arindam) shared a picture of the airport from the JNPT Highway.

Murlidhar Mohol, the Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation, recently shared important updates about the construction of the Navi Mumbai Airport and the timeline to start providing services to passengers. According to a report by The Financial Express, he shared that the project will be completed and ready by March next year. The concerned authorities will begin all operations soon after. On Sunday, the Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation shared the present updates on the Navi Mumbai International Airport project’s construction progression. As of now, the workers have finished 70 per cent of the construction process. Though the infrastructural development was supposed to be completed back in December 2024, it got delayed due to various reasons.

The primary focus at the moment is to finish the rest of the 30 per cent of the Navi Mumbai Airport. The Minister further added that the remaining part of the project will be ready by March 2025. And with the completion, the operations will also begin at the earliest. Also read: Seen The Artwork At New And Upcoming Airports In India? This Art Curator Is Behind It! Updates On Pune Airport

Picture credit- Wikimedia Commons People of Maharashtra are also waiting for the operations to begin at the Pune airport’s new terminal building. Built at a budget of ₹475 crore, it is almost ready. However, there are no confirmed dates announced. A major reason behind the delay is insufficient security staff manpower. Murlidhar Mohol shared that the operations will begin right after getting the necessary CISF force and manpower. The Financial Express report further added that the Airports Authority of India is yet to receive the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security’s regulatory clearance. There are additional plans to extend the Pune airport. The significant reason behind this development is to allow wider-body aircraft to operate and land here. With more options for flights, it will strengthen connections too.

“Why Murder 2 Food Items?” Ask Netizens After Seeing Pune’s Viral Idli Pattice

Recently a viral video showing the making of Idli Pattice in Pune took over the Internet.

Ever heard of Idli Pattice? What’s that? Well, it’s the worst nightmare for Maharashtrians and South Indians. Recently a viral video showing the making of Idli Pattice in Pune took over the Internet. And it’s nothing short of frightening, almost appalling! Read on to know why we’re shocked. Pune’s Popular Idli Pattice Has Sent The Internet On A Frenzy X user Mohammed Futurewala shared a reel originally posted by food vlogger @thefoodiepedia on Instagram. In the caption, the X user wrote that the divine combination of Idli and Vada Pav gave rise to Idli Pattice in Pune. In the video, vendors from Tirupati Snacks Center in Rasta Peth, Pune, are seen preparing this snack. First, mashed spiced potatoes are stuffed between two idlis like a sandwich.

Then, these aloo-stuffed idlis are dunked in pakora batter and deep-fried in hot oil. These Idli Pattices are served with oodles of hot liquid sambar and chutney sitting on top of it. At first glance, these Idli Pattices resemble Aloo Bondas. Unfortunately, these are neither Aloo Bondas nor Idlis.

One person commented that Bata-Wada Sambar was a thing. And as long as the dish didn’t have cheese, ketchup or sev, she was willing to try it. To this, Futurewala replied with conviction that cheese would be added in Gujarat. Another person said that among all the worst things to eat shared by the X user, she would probably be ready to give this a try.

And with this… Pune races ahead of Gujarat in weird food list ! Well done Pune!! — Deepali Prabhu (@Deepali_p) June 13, 2024

Ranvir Shorey Is Shocked Just Like Other Netizens But actor Ranvir Shorey seemed shocked with this fusion dish. And put a “mind-blown” type emoji. Political commentator Abhijit Iyer Mitra reshared the tweet and wrote “Isse koi peetho-zor se” (Someone beat him up badly). @vishalkmumbai called this dish “absolutely disgusting and unhealthy”. The X user asked, “Why murder two different food items?”

Others were shocked about why anyone would even fry idlis. After all idli is known for being one of the healthiest breakfast options. So, why deep fry it with potato and end up with an overall unhealthy and appalling snack? Also Read: From Dosa To Idlis, Here&#8217;s What Akshay Kumar’s Sunday Brunches Look Like

Well, Punekars, have you ever tried Idli Pattice?

Pune: Tamhini Sanctuary Closed Till September 30; Forest Dept Restricts Access After 2 Tourist Deaths

The forest department emphasises the importance of respecting the ban and prioritising personal safety.

[Pune: Tamhini Sanctuary Closed Till September 30; Forest Dept Restricts Access After 2 Tourist Deaths]
Join us Follow us

In a move prioritising visitor safety, the Pune forest department has enacted a temporary ban on tourist entry into the Tamhini sanctuary area. This closure, effective until September 30, follows two tragic tourist deaths at the Milky Bar waterfall in June, both caused by misjudging water depth during the monsoon season.

The monsoon’s impact on the sanctuary’s landscape heightened risks, restricting access. According to a report by Hindustan Times, Tushar Chavan, Deputy Conservator of Forest (Wildlife) for the Pune department, explained that the monsoon transforms Plus Valley and the Tamhini forest.

Heavy rains make roads slick and treacherous, yet tourists are understandably drawn to the area’s allure during this time – pleasant weather, breathtaking scenery, and cascading waterfalls. Unfortunately, some visitors venture into the natural pools at the base of the falls. Here, the monsoon dramatically increases water depth and flow, creating a dangerous situation that can lead to fatal accidents.

Two-Fold Purpose For The Ban

While Tamhini Sanctuary boasts unparalleled natural beauty, these features can become a source of danger during the monsoon. The forest department emphasises the importance of respecting the ban and prioritising personal safety. Visitors who disregard the restrictions and attempt to enter the forest area through trails will face legal repercussions under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.

This temporary closure serves a two-fold purpose. First and foremost, it safeguards visitors from the potential dangers posed by the monsoon-altered landscape. Secondly, it allows the sanctuary’s environment to flourish during this crucial period. The monsoon rains are vital for the health of the ecosystem, replenishing water sources and promoting abundant plant growth.

Tourists who yearn to explore Tamhini’s wonders can utilise this temporary closure as an opportunity to research alternative destinations suitable for the monsoon season. With a bit of planning, they can ensure a safe and enjoyable experience. Come October, the Tamhini sanctuary will once again welcome visitors, ready to unveil its rejuvenated beauty after the monsoon’s embrace.
