The good news is that the present weather conditions are changing and places have started to receive rain. Read on to learn the important rainfall updates nationwide.

Residents of Delhi, Noida, Gurugram, and Ghaziabad woke up to showers and splendid weather as several areas in these places received heavy rainfall. It surely brought a major relief after weeks of unbearable heat and horrifying heatwaves. India Meteorological Department (IMD) already predicted rainfall in parts of the capital city throughout the day. There are expectations for light to moderate-intensity rain and thunderstorms. In addition to this, isolated areas are likely to receive heavy-intensity rainfall and winds with a speed of 20 km/h to 40 km/h in Delhi-NCR, Panipat, Gohana, Gannaur, Sonipat, and nearby places, as shared by RWFC New Delhi on X.

Though it has started to rain in Delhi, the monsoon season is still yet to make a grand entry here. According to a report by NDTV, it is likely that the monsoon will reach the capital city by this week-end. It is expected to begin by June 29 or June 30.

Goa‚Äôs culinary heritage stands out as a vibrant and flavourful testimony to its diverse history. One of the best times to explore this culinary richness is during the festival of S√£o Jo√£o, celebrated with great fervour on June 24th each year. This festival honours an array of traditional delicacies that highlight the essence of Goan cuisine. S√£o Jo√£o Festival: A Celebration Of Tradition & Merriment

Only 5 days to go! Colourful #celebrations, Goan music and festive outfits take over, where Goa celebrates the Sao Joao Festival. Men, women and children jump in lakes and rivers on this day, in tribute to St. John the Baptist. Give us a 'ü§ü' if you're excited about #SaoJoao. pic.twitter.com/QG5yEGaG6N ‚Äî Manohar International Airport (@miagoaairport) June 19, 2023

S√£o Jo√£o is a significant festival in Goa. This festival is celebrated with particular enthusiasm with colourful boat parades, traditional dances, and the unique tradition of jumping into wells, ponds, and rivers. The festival has communities coming together and celebrating with music, dance, and of course, food. The culinary offerings during S√£o Jo√£o are a delightful representation of Goa‚Äôs rich and diverse food culture, which combines influences from Indian, Portuguese, and even African cuisines. Goan cuisine is a harmonious blend of spices, fresh ingredients, and cooking techniques passed down through generations. During S√£o Jo√£o, several traditional dishes are prepared and enjoyed, each telling a story of Goa‚Äôs culinary heritage. The cuisine is also shaped by Hindu Goan traditions, which are evident in vegetarian dishes that are both flavourful and wholesome.

During S√£o Jo√£o, several traditional dishes are prepared and enjoyed, each telling a story of Goa‚Äôs culinary heritage. Sannas hold a special place in Goan households. During S√£o Jo√£o, they are a popular offering. Their unique texture and mildly sweet flavour make them versatile, pairing well with both spicy and sweet dishes. These soft, fluffy steamed rice cakes are an integral part of Goan culinary traditions. Sorpotel is another classic Goan dish with roots in Portuguese cuisine. It is traditionally enjoyed with sannas and steamed rice cakes that complement the dish‚Äôs bold flavours. Among the many traditional dishes savoured during the S√£o Jo√£o festival, Ponsache Holle stands out as a unique and cherished dessert. It is known for its distinct sweet flavour and versatility, especially during the monsoon season when it is harvested in abundance. The key components include ripe jackfruit, jaggery, coconut, and rice flour. Another must-try is the famous Goan chorizo pav, a popular street food that showcases the Indo-Portuguese fusion. Spicy Goan sausages (chorizo) are saut√©ed with onions and spices, then stuffed into a pav (bread roll). This flavorful and hearty snack is a favourite. So, immerse yourself in the flavours of S√£o Jo√£o and discover the gastronomic treasures of Goa. Cover image credits: Flickr; Instagram/Goa Tourism

Are Goa‚Äôs Waterfalls Open During Monsoon Season? Tourism Minister And Forest Department Have Contrasting Views

There is a need for collaborative solutions involving local communities, businesses, and governmental authorities.

Goa‚Äôs picturesque seasonal waterfalls, a draw for tourists and locals alike during the monsoons, have become a focal point of contention between Tourism Minister Rohan Khaunte and the state‚Äôs forest department. Khaunte criticised the department‚Äôs decision to enforce a blanket ban on entry to these natural wonders, citing adverse impacts on rural tourism and local businesses. Are Goa‚Äôs Waterfalls Open During Monsoon Season?

Image Courtesy: Canva Images As per a report by Hindustan Times, Khaunte voiced his concerns in a media statement on Tuesday. He emphasised the importance of balancing safety measures with the promotion of tourism. Khaunte admitted that there are dangers if people don‚Äôt act responsibly at waterfalls, but argued that some waterfalls are safe and should be open for visitors. He said these places are important for both tourism and local businesses. He expressed frustration over what he termed an overly sweeping measure by the forest department, questioning the rationale behind a complete prohibition. Khaunte criticised the blunt ban on waterfalls, arguing it doesn‚Äôt solve the real problems. He proposed a more balanced solution that protects both visitors and the environment. To achieve this, he plans to have discussions with relevant authorities, including the Chief Minister and Forest Minister.

Image Courtesy: Canva Images The ban on waterfall access echoes a similar restriction imposed last year following tragic incidents, including drownings during picnics. Despite the concerns, locals, particularly from Netravali village, where several waterfalls are located, have protested against the ban, highlighting its adverse impact on their livelihoods. As per a report by Hindustan Times, Forest Minister Vishwajit Rane defended the department‚Äôs stance, prioritising public safety amidst recent incidents of drowning. Rane defended the decision, emphasising that only safe (low-risk) waterfalls would be accessible. He stressed that public safety is their top priority. The debate underscores Goa‚Äôs challenge in balancing conservation imperatives with tourism promotion, especially during the monsoon season when natural attractions are at their most captivating but also pose heightened safety risks. The issue has sparked a broader conversation about responsible tourism management and the need for collaborative solutions involving local communities, businesses, and governmental authorities.

‚ÄúToo hot? Let‚Äôs head to Goa and beat the heat with beer. Too cold? Let‚Äôs plan a year-end trip to Goa. Monsoon season? Let‚Äôs travel to Goa and see the Dudhsagar Falls,‚Äù does this sound familiar? After all, Goa is perfect for a holiday, 365 days in a year. It is always a great time to plan a holiday to this alluring beach destination. Home to abundant scenic natural beauty, this place offers the best travel and culinary experiences. Tourists are enjoying a splendid time in Goa as the destination welcomed a footfall of 1 crore tourists despite the monsoon and off-season for tourists.

Monsoon has entered this Indian state marking the end of one of the high-in-demand holiday seasons. This tourist season recorded magnificent numbers showing tremendous growth in the tourism sector. Rohan Khaunte, Minister of Tourism of Goa, shared Goa welcomed one crore travellers this tourist season, according to a report by Hindustan Times. Looks like COVID-19‚Äôs effects have finally recovered to a major extent. Both domestic and overseas visitors have chosen Goa as their travel destination during this period to explore picturesque landscapes and enjoy spectacular experiences. Compared to the peak seasons before the pandemic, the state reported a surge in foreign travellers by 150 per cent this time. The coastal state has witnessed fantastic numbers even after having a long list of competing travel destinations, both in India and abroad.

He shared how meetings will be conducted with the hotel industry and airlines to discuss this issue. Also read: Heard Of Ghotache Sasav, A Goan Dish Made With Mangoes?

The peak holiday season has concluded here. However, a huge number of tourists are still booking tickets to Goa to enjoy the serene rainy season. Gone are those days when tourists visited this coastal destination only to explore beaches and enjoy the nightlife. Now, many travellers visit to relax and enjoy the charisma of offbeat travel. Goa is home to several rejuvenating experiences and rural tourism and is perfect for staying away from the daily hustle. Rohan Khaunte shared insights about the present numbers of travel demand. 80 per cent of hotels are already booked by visitors. Ahead of the next major holiday season starting in September, Goa is likely to welcome an impressive number of tourists this monsoon as well.

Start by thoroughly washing the mangoes. After that, smash and peel them and keep them aside for the meantime. In a pan, take some mustard and pepper seeds and dry roast them. Now, add one fully grated coconut to the roasted mustard and pepper seeds. Cook it for a few minutes and take it off the flame. Now, put them in a mixer and blend it all together. Coming back to the mangoes, take them in a wide pan and add one and a half teaspoons of red chilli powder, one teaspoon of turmeric powder, and salt as per taste to it. Mix it all together and add enough water to cover the mangoes. To balance the sourness of the dish, add some jaggery to the mix. Cover the pan and let the dish cook on medium to low flame. Now, add 2-3 tablespoons of the mustard-pepper-coconut masala blend to the pan and let it cook for some more time. In the meantime, take some ghee in a small pan and add hing and curry leaves to it to make a tadka for the Ghotache Sasav. Take the dish off the flame, add the tadka on top and that‚Äôs it, your dish is ready to be served!

Sydney Metro Employs Special Task Force Of 20 Goats To Clear Land By Grazing; You Herd It Right!

The team of 20 Boer goats will graze on the site for the next three weeks.

What‚Äôs a task force of goats ‚Äúgoat‚Äù to do with the Sydney Metro? Well, if you‚Äôre wondering the same then we ‚Äúherd‚Äù your queries. Sydney Metro West will be building a 24-kilometre-long transport line between Greater Parramatta and Sydney CBD. Here, super-fast trains will run every four minutes from the nine brand-new stations. Read on to know why goats have an integral role to play in this ambitious metro project. 20 Goats Employed By Sydney Metro To Clear Land Of Weed & Grass As per a report by TimeOut, a special task force of 20 goats which includes a cute one-year-old kid have been employed by Transport for NSW. The herd of 20 goats will join construction workers in Western Sydney to bring the new Sydney Metro project to life. Transport for NSW has resorted to an age-old method of clearing land. This is by letting a herd of goats graze on the land. The team of 20 Boer goats will graze on the site for the next three weeks.

Picture Credits: Canva Pro Instead of using machines or pesticides, authorities have chosen goats thanks to their positive impact on the environment. The goats will join the team of 570 construction workers in Western Sydney. They will help clear land and weeds. Jo Haylen MP, Minister for Transport, stated to TimeOut stated that when it comes to the landscaping game for such types of mega projects they believe, ‚Äúno goats, no glory.‚Äù So, they have deployed goats to ensure this metro project is a resounding success. Moreover, Jo Haylen states that the team of 20 goats are the star employees. Also Read: You Can Now Have A Playdate With Baby Goats At THIS Mutton-Free Restaurant In Dubai Living The G.O.A.T Life! Transport for NSW confirmed that the furry workers will be very cared for. They will have access to fresh water and shade for 24 hours a day. Also, construction workers will frequent the site regularly to check up on their welfare. The goats are playing a crucial role in Sydney‚Äôs future transport network. By clearing out the grass and weeds from the site, construction workers can install 150,000 concrete segments on the land. And this will help form tunnels to house Sydney‚Äôs Metro West.

The Aguada Port and Jail Complex holds a pivotal place in Goa‚Äôs history. Dating back to the 16th century, it was constructed by the Portuguese. Its strategic location at the mouth of the Mandovi River facilitated the safe passage of ships laden with precious cargo. The adjoining Aguada Jail adds another layer of historical significance to the complex. Initially serving as a prison for political dissidents and freedom fighters, Aguada Jail became a symbol of resistance against colonial oppression. Over the years, it housed nationalists, revolutionaries, and common criminals, each leaving their mark on its storied walls. This ambitious effort to renovate the historic site is a major step towards bringing Goa‚Äôs rich legacy back to life. Additionally, it‚Äôs important to see Goa beyond beaches and provide tourists with an amazing travel experience. Cover image credits: Instagram/AguadGoa
