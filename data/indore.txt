Passenger High On Bhang Tries To Open Door On IndiGo Indore-Hyderabad Flight; Arrested

He even allegedly misbehaved during the flight.

Share

Recently, a passenger on an IndiGo flight from Indore to Hyderabad was arrested for reportedly attempting to open the door while the flight was landing. He was arrested for doing this. If reports are to go by, the passenger had consumed bhang before boarding the flight. He even allegedly misbehaved during the flight. Here are all of the other important details that you would need to know about this peculiar incident. Passenger High On Bhang Tries To Open The Door On Flight

Image Credits: Wikimedia Commons According to an article which was recently published by News18, the arrested passenger is 29 years old and is named Anil Patil. He was travelling with his friends from Indore. As per the article, the group was returning from a pilgrimage in Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh. He is a resident of Chandragirinagar in Gajularamaram. Before boarding the flight, he reportedly consumed bhang. Soon after boarding the flight, the crew noticed his unusual behaviour and moved him to a different seat. However, the passenger insisted on being seated next to his friends so he was moved again. Soon after, he again misbehaved, this time with another passenger. The crew also reported that he kept walking up and down the aisle for no conceivable reason when the flight was mid-air.

Image Credits: Wikimedia Commons Right before the flight was about to land at the Rajiv Gandhi Internationa Airport or RGIA in Hyderabad, Patil got into an argument with a crew member. Then, when the pilot was getting ready to land the aircraft, Patil tried to open the door of the flight. He was stopped by other crew members. Once the plane landed in the Hyderabad airport, he was handed over to the authorities and was arrested. It was claimed that he suffered from “health issues.” Medical reports were also submitted supporting the claims Patil was given bail. Such incidents serve as a reminder to the passenger to not be an inconvenience to others when travelling.

Trains Between Indore & Mhow Discontinued For 15 Days; Here’s Why

Trains between Indore and Mhow have been cancelled due to important projects.

by Shreya Ghosh Updated: May 2, 2024

Share

Attention passengers! Do you have plans to travel to Madhya Pradesh in the next 2 weeks? If yes, read this article carefully as many trains have been cancelled on a specific route of the state. Trains operating between Indore and Mhow have been paused from providing services temporarily for 15 days. To know more information about the temporary discontinuation of trains on this route in Madhya Pradesh, read on. This Is Why Trains Between Indore And Mhow Have Been Cancelled

Picture credit- CanvaImage for representation Trains travelling on the above-mentioned route in Madhya Pradesh have been discontinued temporarily from Thursday, according to a report by The Free Press Journal. There is a significant reason behind cancelling so many trains between Indore and Mhow. Reports state that development work is going on for the Mhow-Patalpani Broad Gauge Line Project, the Mhow Yard Remodelling, and the Rau-Mhow Doubling. And the operations have been paused for these projects. For all these necessary ongoing projects, a meeting was conducted previously. It was a meeting for 2 days of the construction department’s officials of the Ratlam division and the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS). After the decisions, the concerned department finalised 2 dates to conduct the CRS inspection. Construction work on these developmental projects will continue as usual except for May 13. This is the voting day and that’s why the work will be paused. For long-distance trains from Mhow, the route will be from Indore and Laxmibai Nagar. Kamakhya Express, Yesvantpur, Malwa Express, Yesvantpur, Prayagraj and Rewa Express departing from Mhow will operate from Indore. The report also added that the Mhow-Bhopal Intercity will continue its journey from Indore.

Picture credit- CanvaImage for representation All the construction projects are ongoing in full swing. The construction of the Mhow-Patalpani Broad Gauge Line Project and the Rau-Mhow Doubling projects are close to completion, shared an official. Mhow Railway Station is getting ready for yard remodelling as the tracks have been positioned on 1 and 4 platforms. A few steps of this project are signalling, getting rid of any additional lines, and adding the necessary ones.

Woman Sells Chocolate Cheese Vada Pav In Indore; Netizens Say, “Soch Ke Hi Ulti Aa Rahi Hai”

Another day and another viral trend of strange recipes!

Are you tired of watching weird combinations and recipes of different dishes going viral on the Internet? Well, I am fed up already! Every day, we come across so many such bizarre videos on different social media platforms and all we can think of is “Kaun hai yeh log? Kaha se aate hai yeh?” The latest unnecessary creation is Chocolate Cheese Vada Pav and I am confused about how to react to it. Chocolate Cheese Vada Pav Is The Latest Bizarre Food Trend! Taking to Instagram, Foodpandits! (@foodpandits) shared his experience of trying this never-seen-before vada pav at a street food stall in Indore.

Vada Pav holds a special corner in most foodies’ hearts, especially for Mumbaikars. This humble deep-fried street food is nothing but bites of deliciousness loaded with spicy flavours. Previously, dosa, tea, pizza, Maggi, and many of our favourite soul food items were not spared and vada pav was also dragged into all these experiments a lot of times. The most recent weird recipe made with Vada Pav is Chocolate Cheese Vada Pav. It is cooked using all the ingredients that are not really needed usually. The woman starts making it by dipping biscuits in a batter of besan and then deep frying them. Next, she drizzles chocolate syrup on a pav and adds grated cheese, crushed biscuits, and vada. Next, she adds butter to a toaster and toasts the vada pav. Lastly, she adds more grated cheese, chocolate syrup, brown and white chocolate chips, and a cigar roll on top of the chocolate cheese vada pav. The vendor shared in the video that children actually enjoy eating this strange blend of fried biscuits, pav, cheese, and chocolate.

Picture credit- Instagram/ Foodpandits! (@foodpandits) Instagrammers are clearly too tired of watching all these reels of strange recipes. They are kind of ranting out about chocolate cheese vada pav in the comments. Someone responded by commenting, “Soch ke hi ulti aa rahi hai.” Mumbaikars are fed up and someone from the city commented, “A Mumbaikar can’t stand this…. Please stop playing with our emotions (vada pav).” A Netizen reacted saying, “Mar jaunga, par yeh nhi khaunga.” Another comment read, “Zeher khaa liya bhai ne.” Also read: Woman&#8217;s Online Cake Order Goes Wrong Due To Unclear Instructions; Netizens Say, &#8220;Happy Birthday To Stick!” Will you try chocolate cheese vada pav?

But in 2019, a vegetarian hot dog from Indore took the spotlight At a small stall called Johnny Hot Dog, located at the bustling 56 Dukan market in Indore, this unique vegetarian hot dog won the title of ‘Most Popular Menu Item in Asia Pacific’ at the Uber Eats Future of Food Summit in Hong Kong.

It’s topped with ketchup, spicy chutney, and raw onions, giving it a unique burst of flavour and texture. This mouthwatering dish quickly became a hit, with Indore residents ordering over one lakh of these hot dogs within just 92 days between June and August of 2019.

In The Outskirts Of Indore, MP’s Sirpur Wetland Is A Ramsar Site & A Biodiversity Haven

Sirpur Wetland is a haven for a diverse array of plant and animal species.

Spread across a vast expanse, Sirpur Wetland is a natural gem. With its diverse flora and fauna, serene landscapes, and rich cultural significance, this wetland in Indore is special since it’s an urban lake that was destroyed and then painstakingly rebuilt. A Man-Made Lake

Sirpur Wetland, the third designated Ramsar Site in Madhya Pradesh, is special since it is an urban lake that has been meticulously restored after falling into complete disrepair. Established about 130 years ago, this wetland is a 670-acre lake created by Maharaja Shivajirao Holkar to supply water to the city of Indore. The lake’s history dates back to the late 19th century when the former Holkar kings had it constructed. It is located on Dhar Road, a short 2 kilometres from the bustling Gangwal Bus Stand. It was located far from the bustle of the city and surrounded by farmland and forests. However, the wetland faces numerous challenges that threaten its existence, underscoring the need for concerted conservation efforts  Currently, an urban population surrounds the lake and it is under extreme strain inside its catchment areas. The Nature Volunteers, an NGO founded by ardent environmentalists in Indore, has been devotedly fighting for the preservation of Sirpur Lake for the past 28 years. To raise public knowledge of the wetland and its significance, the NGO organises events and programs. A few examples of these include birding camps, workshops on biodiversity protection, water testing drives, and bird count surveys.

Sirpur Wetland is a haven for a diverse array of plant and animal species. The wetland supports a rich vegetation cover. It includes aquatic plants such as water lilies, lotus, and water hyacinths, along with terrestrial species like grasses, shrubs, and trees. These plant communities provide food, shelter, and nesting sites for a plethora of wildlife. Sirpur features an amazing blend of open fallow land, scrub jungle, aquatic environment, and a garden with large, ancient fig, tamarind, and gulmohar trees. It is home to a sizable resident bird population as well as a winter refuge for migratory species. A birdwatching path around the lake’s bund is ideal for up-close views of several resident and migratory bird species. The wetland teems with avian life, attracting migratory birds from various parts of the world. Species such as bar-headed geese, northern pintails, Asian openbills, and Sarus cranes flock to Sirpur during the winter months. Additionally, the wetland is home to resident birds like kingfishers, herons, egrets, and jacanas, which thrive in its marshy habitats. Its breathtaking landscapes, diverse flora and fauna, and rich historical legacy make it a treasure trove of biodiversity and tranquillity.

Indore-Bound IndiGo Flight Makes Emergency Landing In Bengaluru After Facing Technical Snag Soon After Take Off

An IndiGo Bengaluru-Indore flight made an emergency landing at Bengaluru Airport after the pilot noticed a technical snag after take off.

IndiGo has recently been in the news due to delays and flight cancellations. This time, an Indore-bound IndiGo flight made an emergency landing in Bengaluru after the aircraft faced a technical snag during take-off. Read on to know more about this issue in detail. IndiGo Bengaluru-Indore Flight Faced Technical Snag After Take Off

Picture Credits: Wikipedia A report by The Free Press Journal stated that IndiGo flight 6E-6743 was scheduled to take off from Bengaluru Airport at 7 PM and reach its destination, Indore at 9:05 PM. Information from Devi Ahilyabai Holkar Airport stated that an untoward incident happened at around 6:30 PM. The flight with over 100 passengers on board soon after takeoff, on reaching Anantapur faced technical faults. The pilot detected signs of a technical fault. So, the pilot contacted Bengaluru Airport’s Air Traffic Control ad sought permission to divert the flight and return to Bengaluru Airport. The IndiGo flight escaped a potential disaster after facing this technical takeoff soon after take-off. The ATC gave the pilot permission to land the flight back at Bengaluru Airport. Also, the ATC alerted Bengaluru Airport and directed it to bring its emergency response teams, medical personnel and fire brigade on the tarmac.

Picture Credits: Canva Much to the relief of the passengers and the crew,  despite the technical snag, the pilot safely landed the flight at Bengaluru Airport. The medical personnel and fire brigade were strategically placed on the runway to avoid any emergencies that may arise during the landing. Engineers examined the aircraft and later stated that immediate repairs weren’t possible due to the high budgets required. So, this resulted in cancelling the flight. The passengers had no choice but to de-board the flight due to this unexpected development which resulted in major inconvenience. This news comes after a Bhubaneswar-Varanasi IndiGo flight was cancelled due to fog in northern India due to chilly winters. Airport Director, Prasanna Pradhan stated to TOI that the small aircraft with 72 seats may have trouble landing at night in Varanasi due to fog.
